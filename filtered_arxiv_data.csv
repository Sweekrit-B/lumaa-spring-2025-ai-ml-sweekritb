0,['cs.LG'],Multi-Level Attention Pooling for Graph Neural Networks: Unifying Graph Representations with Multiple Localities,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to learn vector
representation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance
than conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing
procedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since
this procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information
propagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the
higher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global
structural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN
models suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local
information, which would be essential for good model performance, through many
message passing steps. In this study, we propose multi-level attention pooling
(MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both local and
global structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling layer for
each message passing step and computes the final graph representation by
unifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows
models to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of
localities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due
to oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture
improves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline
architectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph representations
suggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of localities indeed
has the potential to improve the discriminability of learned graph
representations."
1,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",Decision Forests vs. Deep Networks: Conceptual Similarities and Empirical Differences at Small Sample Sizes,"Deep networks and decision forests (such as random forests and gradient
boosted trees) are the leading machine learning methods for structured and
tabular data, respectively. Many papers have empirically compared large numbers
of classifiers on one or two different domains (e.g., on 100 different tabular
data settings). However, a careful conceptual and empirical comparison of these
two strategies using the most contemporary best practices has yet to be
performed. Conceptually, we illustrate that both can be profitably viewed as
""partition and vote"" schemes. Specifically, the representation space that they
both learn is a partitioning of feature space into a union of convex polytopes.
For inference, each decides on the basis of votes from the activated nodes.
This formulation allows for a unified basic understanding of the relationship
between these methods. Empirically, we compare these two strategies on hundreds
of tabular data settings, as well as several vision and auditory settings. Our
focus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent a large
fraction of scientific and biomedical datasets. In general, we found forests to
excel at tabular and structured data (vision and audition) with small sample
sizes, whereas deep nets performed better on structured data with larger sample
sizes. This suggests that further gains in both scenarios may be realized via
further combining aspects of forests and networks. We will continue revising
this technical report in the coming months with updated results."

data. However, they have been recently shown to be vulnerable to topological
attacks. To enhance adversarial robustness, we go beyond spectral graph theory
to robust graph theory. By challenging the classical graph Laplacian, we
propose a new convolution operator that is provably robust in the spectral
domain and is incorporated in the GCN architecture to improve expressivity and
interpretability. By extending the original graph to a sequence of graphs, we
also propose a robust training paradigm that encourages transferability across
graphs that span a range of spatial and spectral characteristics. The proposed
approaches are demonstrated in extensive experiments to simultaneously improve
performance in both benign and adversarial situations."
3,"['cs.LG', 'cs.CR']",Releasing Graph Neural Networks with Differential Privacy Guarantees,"With the increasing popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in several
sensitive applications like healthcare and medicine, concerns have been raised
over the privacy aspects of trained GNNs. More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to
privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox
access to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy
has emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets.
Following the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE),
recent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models. These teachers are
trained on disjoint subsets of private data and are employed to transfer
knowledge to a student model, which is then released with privacy guarantees.
However, splitting graph data into many disjoint training sets may destroy the
structural information and adversely affect accuracy. We propose a new
graph-specific scheme of releasing a student GNN, which avoids splitting
private training data altogether. The student GNN is trained using public data,
partly labeled privately using the teacher GNN models trained exclusively for
each query node. We theoretically analyze our approach in the R\`{e}nyi
differential privacy framework and provide privacy guarantees. Besides, we show
the solid experimental performance of our method compared to several baselines,
including the PATE baseline adapted for graph-structured data. Our anonymized
code is available."
4,['cs.LG'],Recurrence-Aware Long-Term Cognitive Network for Explainable Pattern Classification,"Machine learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays
widely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and
accountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,
there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence
mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature
contributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by
black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic
interpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models
that are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks.
In this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable
pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism
for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the
decision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the
performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear
reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a
recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by unique fixed
points while introducing a deterministic learning method to compute the tunable
parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains
competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art white and black-box
models."
5,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Lifelong Graph Learning,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models for many graph-structured
tasks. Existing models often assume that a complete structure of a graph is
available during training, however, in practice, graph-structured data is
usually formed in a streaming fashion, so that learning a graph continuously is
often necessary. In this paper, we aim to bridge GNN to lifelong learning by
converting a graph problem to a regular learning problem, so that GNN is able
to inherit the lifelong learning techniques developed for convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). To this end, we propose a new graph topology based on feature
cross-correlation, called the feature graph. It takes features as new nodes and
turns nodes into independent graphs. This successfully converts the original
problem of node classification to graph classification, in which the increasing
nodes are turned into independent training samples. In the experiments, we
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of feature graph networks (FGN) by
continuously learning a sequence of classical graph datasets. We also show that
FGN achieves superior performance in human action recognition with distributed
streaming signals for wearable devices."
6,['cs.LG'],Bayesian graph convolutional neural networks via tempered MCMC,"Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, have long been
applied to image and multi-media tasks, particularly those with structured
data. More recently, there has been more attention to unstructured data that
can be represented via graphs. These types of data are often found in health
and medicine, social networks, and research data repositories. Graph
convolutional neural networks have recently gained attention in the field of
deep learning that takes advantage of graph-based data representation with
automatic feature extraction via convolutions. Given the popularity of these
methods in a wide range of applications, robust uncertainty quantification is
vital. This remains a challenge for large models and unstructured datasets.
Bayesian inference provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification
of model parameters for deep learning models. Although Bayesian inference has
been used extensively elsewhere, its application to deep learning remains
limited due to the computational requirements of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods. Recent advances in parallel computing and advanced proposal
schemes in MCMC sampling methods has opened the path for Bayesian deep
learning. In this paper, we present Bayesian graph convolutional neural
networks that employ tempered MCMC sampling with Langevin-gradient proposal
distribution implemented via parallel computing. Our results show that the
proposed method can provide accuracy similar to advanced optimisers while
providing uncertainty quantification for key benchmark problems."
7,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Understanding and Resolving Performance Degradation in Graph Convolutional Networks,"A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) stacks several layers and in each layer
performs a PROPagation operation (PROP) and a TRANsformation operation (TRAN)
for learning node representations over graph-structured data. Though powerful,
GCNs tend to suffer performance drop when the model gets deep. Previous works
focus on PROPs to study and mitigate this issue, but the role of TRANs is
barely investigated. In this work, we study performance degradation of GCNs by
experimentally examining how stacking only TRANs or PROPs works. We find that
TRANs contribute significantly, or even more than PROPs, to declining
performance, and moreover that they tend to amplify node-wise feature variance
in GCNs, causing variance inflammation that we identify as a key factor for
causing performance drop. Motivated by such observations, we propose a
variance-controlling technique termed Node Normalization (NodeNorm), which
scales each node's features using its own standard deviation. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of NodeNorm on addressing performance
degradation of GCNs. Specifically, it enables deep GCNs to outperform shallow
ones in cases where deep models are needed, and to achieve comparable results
with shallow ones on 6 benchmark datasets. NodeNorm is a generic plug-in and
can well generalize to other GNN architectures. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/miafei/NodeNorm."
8,['cs.LG'],Edge-augmented Graph Transformers: Global Self-attention is Enough for Graphs,"Transformer neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results for
unstructured data such as text and images but their adoption for
graph-structured data has been limited. This is partly due to the difficulty of
incorporating complex structural information in the basic transformer
framework. We propose a simple yet powerful extension to the transformer -
residual edge channels. The resultant framework, which we call Edge-augmented
Graph Transformer (EGT), can directly accept, process and output structural
information as well as node information. It allows us to use global
self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and comes
with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the edge
channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer, and
prediction tasks on edges/links can be performed directly from the output
embeddings of these channels. In addition, we introduce a generalized
positional encoding scheme for graphs based on Singular Value Decomposition
which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which relies on global
node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared to
Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks, which rely on local
feature aggregation within a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in
a supervised learning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark
datasets. Our findings indicate that convolutional aggregation is not an
essential inductive bias for graphs and global self-attention can serve as a
flexible and adaptive alternative."
9,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",Variational Graph Normalized Auto-Encoders,"Link prediction is one of the key problems for graph-structured data. With
the advancement of graph neural networks, graph autoencoders (GAEs) and
variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) have been proposed to learn graph
embeddings in an unsupervised way. It has been shown that these methods are
effective for link prediction tasks. However, they do not work well in link
predictions when a node whose degree is zero (i.g., isolated node) is involved.
We have found that GAEs/VGAEs make embeddings of isolated nodes close to zero
regardless of their content features. In this paper, we propose a novel
Variational Graph Normalized AutoEncoder (VGNAE) that utilize L2-normalization
to derive better embeddings for isolated nodes. We show that our VGNAEs
outperform the existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction tasks. The
code is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/VGNAE."
10,['cs.LG'],Local Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks,"Data augmentation has been widely used in image data and linguistic data but
remains under-explored on graph-structured data. Existing methods focus on
augmenting the graph data from a global perspective and largely fall into two
genres: structural manipulation and adversarial training with feature noise
injection. However, the structural manipulation approach suffers information
loss issues while the adversarial training approach may downgrade the feature
quality by injecting noise. In this work, we introduce the local augmentation,
which enhances node features by its local subgraph structures. Specifically, we
model the data argumentation as a feature generation process. Given the central
node's feature, our local augmentation approach learns the conditional
distribution of its neighbors' features and generates the neighbors' optimal
feature to boost the performance of downstream tasks. Based on the local
augmentation, we further design a novel framework: LA-GNN, which can apply to
any GNN models in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments and analyses
show that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement for
various GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. Code is available

11,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.DC']",FedGraphNN: A Federated Learning System and Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks,"Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity
of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data.
However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN
training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and
commercial competitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed
learning paradigm, provides possibilities to solve this challenge while
preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language
domains, there is no suitable platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we
introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research
on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and
contains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models,
and FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for
the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains,
including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as
hERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark
system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs
perform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the
GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not
maintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more
research efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs.
Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN
system is computationally efficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets.
We maintain the source code at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedGraphNN."
12,['cs.LG'],Diff-ResNets for Few-shot Learning -- an ODE Perspective,"Interpreting deep neural networks from the ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) perspective has inspired many efficient and robust network
architectures. However, existing ODE based approaches ignore the relationship
among data points, which is a critical component in many problems including
few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning. In this paper, inspired by the
diffusive ODEs, we propose a novel diffusion residual network (Diff-ResNet) to
strengthen the interactions among data points. Under the structured data
assumption, it is proved that the diffusion mechanism can decrease the
distance-diameter ratio that improves the separability of inter-class points
and reduces the distance among local intra-class points. This property can be
easily adopted by the residual networks for constructing the separable
hyperplanes. The synthetic binary classification experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed diffusion mechanism. Moreover, extensive
experiments of few-shot image classification and semi-supervised graph node
classification in various datasets validate the advantages of the proposed
Diff-ResNet over existing few-shot learning methods."
13,"['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'physics.data-an']",Scale-invariant representation of machine learning,"The success of machine learning stems from its structured data
representation. Similar data have close representation as compressed codes for
classification or emerged labels for clustering. We observe that the frequency
of the internal representation follows power laws in both supervised and
unsupervised learning. The scale-invariant distribution implies that machine
learning largely compresses frequent typical data, and at the same time,
differentiates many atypical data as outliers. In this study, we derive how the
power laws can naturally arise in machine learning. In terms of information
theory, the scale-invariant representation corresponds to a maximally uncertain
data grouping among possible representations that guarantee pre-specified
learning accuracy."
14,['cs.LG'],Generation of Synthetic Electronic Health Records Using a Federated GAN,"Sensitive medical data is often subject to strict usage constraints. In this
paper, we trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) on real-world
electronic health records (EHR). It was then used to create a data-set of
""fake"" patients through synthetic data generation (SDG) to circumvent usage
constraints. This real-world data was tabular, binary, intensive care unit
(ICU) patient diagnosis data. The entire data-set was split into separate data
silos to mimic real-world scenarios where multiple ICU units across different
hospitals may have similarly structured data-sets within their own
organisations but do not have access to each other's data-sets. We implemented
federated learning (FL) to train separate GANs locally at each organisation,
using their unique data silo and then combining the GANs into a single central
GAN, without any siloed data ever being exposed. This global, central GAN was
then used to generate the synthetic patients data-set. We performed an
evaluation of these synthetic patients with statistical measures and through a
structured review by a group of medical professionals. It was shown that there
was no significant reduction in the quality of the synthetic EHR when we moved
between training a single central model and training on separate data silos
with individual models before combining them into a central model. This was
true for both the statistical evaluation (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.0154 for single-source vs. RMSE of 0.0169 for dual-source federated) and also
for the medical professionals' evaluation (no quality difference between EHR
generated from a single source and EHR generated from multiple sources)."
15,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.SI']",Sparsifying the Update Step in Graph Neural Networks,"Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), the most prominent Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of
graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network
models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this
paper, we conduct a structured study of the effect of sparsification on the
trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design a
series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update
step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable
sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform
in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature, the
sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network
architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained
architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the
influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing
simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The
ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance
on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks while
containing significantly fewer trainable parameters. In experiments with
matching parameter numbers, our benchmark models outperform the
state-of-the-art GNN models. Our code is publicly available at:

16,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.DS']",Computing Graph Descriptors on Edge Streams,"Graph feature extraction is a fundamental task in graphs analytics. Using
feature vectors (graph descriptors) in tandem with data mining algorithms that
operate on Euclidean data, one can solve problems such as classification,
clustering, and anomaly detection on graph-structured data. This idea has
proved fruitful in the past, with spectral-based graph descriptors providing
state-of-the-art classification accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, these
algorithms do not scale to large graphs since: 1) they require storing the
entire graph in memory, and 2) the end-user has no control over the algorithm's
runtime. In this paper, we present single-pass streaming algorithms to
approximate structural features of graphs (counts of subgraphs of order $k \geq
4$). Operating on edge streams allows us to avoid keeping the entire graph in
memory, and controlling the sample size enables us to control the time taken by
the algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our descriptors by analyzing the
approximation error, classification accuracy, and scalability to massive
graphs. Our experiments showcase the effect of the sample size on approximation
error and predictive accuracy. The proposed descriptors are applicable on
graphs with millions of edges within minutes and outperform the
state-of-the-art descriptors in classification accuracy."
17,"['cs.LG', '68T30', 'I.5.4']",Deep Dual Support Vector Data Description for Anomaly Detection on Attributed Networks,"Networks are ubiquitous in the real world such as social networks and
communication networks, and anomaly detection on networks aims at finding nodes
whose structural or attributed patterns deviate significantly from the majority
of reference nodes. However, most of the traditional anomaly detection methods
neglect the relation structure information among data points and therefore
cannot effectively generalize to the graph structure data. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end model of Deep Dual Support Vector Data description based
Autoencoder (Dual-SVDAE) for anomaly detection on attributed networks, which
considers both the structure and attribute for attributed networks.
Specifically, Dual-SVDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute
autoencoder to learn the latent representation of the node in the structure
space and attribute space respectively. Then, a dual-hypersphere learning
mechanism is imposed on them to learn two hyperspheres of normal nodes from the
structure and attribute perspectives respectively. Moreover, to achieve joint
learning between the structure and attribute of the network, we fuse the
structure embedding and attribute embedding as the final input of the feature
decoder to generate the node attribute. Finally, abnormal nodes can be detected
by measuring the distance of nodes to the learned center of each hypersphere in
the latent structure space and attribute space respectively. Extensive
experiments on the real-world attributed networks show that Dual-SVDAE
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed method."
18,['cs.LG'],Learning Fair Graph Neural Networks with Limited and Private Sensitive Attribute Information,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great power in modeling graph
structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs may
make biased predictions w.r.t protected sensitive attributes, e.g., skin color
and gender. This is because the training data often contains historical bias
towards sensitive attributes. In addition, we empirically show that the
discrimination in GNNs can be magnified by graph structures and the
message-passing mechanism of GNNs. As a result, the applications of GNNs in
high-stake domains such as crime rate prediction would be largely limited.
Though extensive studies of fair classification have been conducted on i.i.d
data, methods to address the problem of discrimination on non-i.i.d data are
rather limited. Generally, learning fair models require abundant sensitive
attributes to regularize the model. However, for many graphs such as social
networks, users are reluctant to share sensitive attributes. Thus, only limited
sensitive attributes are available for fair GNN training in practice. Moreover,
directly collecting and applying the sensitive attributes in fair model
training may cause privacy issues, because the sensitive information can be
leaked in data breach or attacks on the trained model. Therefore, we study a
novel and crucial problem of learning fair GNNs with limited and private
sensitive attribute information. In an attempt to address these problems,
FairGNN is proposed to eliminate the bias of GNNs whilst maintaining high
accuracy by leveraging graph structures and limited sensitive information. We
further extend FairGNN to NT-FairGNN which can achieve both fairness and
privacy on sensitive attributes by using limited and private sensitive
attributes. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGNN and NT-FairGNN in achieving
fair and high-accurate classification."

permutation invariant unnormalized density functions on graphs. Unlike standard
EBM training methods our approach is to learn the model via minimizing
adversarial stein discrepancy. Samples from the model can be obtained via
Langevin dynamics based MCMC. We find that this approach achieves competitive

embeddings of structured data. The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1)
Compute a graphical representation of a dataset (fuzzy simplicial complex), and
(2) Through stochastic gradient descent, optimize a low-dimensional embedding
of the graph. Here, we extend the second step of UMAP to a parametric
optimization over neural network weights, learning a parametric relationship
between data and embedding. We first demonstrate that Parametric UMAP performs
comparably to its non-parametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a
learned parametric mapping (e.g. fast online embeddings for new data). We then
explore UMAP as a regularization, constraining the latent distribution of
autoencoders, parametrically varying global structure preservation, and

graph-structured data, have achieved great success in modeling graphs. However,
as an extension of deep learning for graphs, GNNs lack explainability, which
largely limits their adoption in scenarios that demand the transparency of
models. Though many efforts are taken to improve the explainability of deep
learning, they mainly focus on i.i.d data, which cannot be directly applied to
explain the predictions of GNNs because GNNs utilize both node features and
graph topology to make predictions. There are only very few work on the
explainability of GNNs and they focus on post-hoc explanations. Since post-hoc
explanations are not directly obtained from the GNNs, they can be biased and
misrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel
problem of self-explainable GNNs which can simultaneously give predictions and
explanations. We propose a new framework which can find $K$-nearest labeled
nodes for each unlabeled node to give explainable node classification, where
nearest labeled nodes are found by interpretable similarity module in terms of
both node similarity and local structure similarity. Extensive experiments on
real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

significant impact on many real-world applications. However, less attention has
been paid to the evolving nature of temporal networks, in which the edges are
often changing over time. The embeddings of such temporal networks should
encode both graph-structured information and the temporally evolving pattern.
Existing approaches in learning temporally evolving network representations
fail to capture the temporal interdependence. In this paper, we propose Toffee,
a novel approach for temporal network representation learning based on tensor
decomposition. Our method exploits the tensor-tensor product operator to encode
the cross-time information, so that the periodic changes in the evolving
networks can be captured. Experimental results demonstrate that Toffee
outperforms existing methods on multiple real-world temporal networks in
generating effective embeddings for the link prediction tasks."
23,['cs.LG'],LinkTeller: Recovering Private Edges from Graph Neural Networks via Influence Analysis,"Graph structured data have enabled several successful applications such as
recommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and
edges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order
adjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data
holders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder
will only own either the node features or edge information), different data
holders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly
transfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on
the edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features
will first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency
information. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint
information and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to
provide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test
nodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via
influence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via
designing adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller
is able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming
existing baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an
existing algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP
GCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these
DP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under
mild privacy guarantees ($\varepsilon>5$). Our studies will shed light on
future research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models;
in the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between GCN
model utility and robustness against potential privacy attacks."

dynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19
spread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of
spatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning
characteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics
laws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions.
One of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate
the perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through
the distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of
machine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for
model training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is
objectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human
intervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of
expertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal
physics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics
of the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the
learning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints,
an active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most
informative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable
environment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit
that the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal

graph-structured data, showing promising results in various applications such
as node classification, link prediction and network recommendation. In this
paper, we present a new graph attention neural network, namely GIPA, for
attributed graph data learning. GIPA consists of three key components:
attention, feature propagation and aggregation. Specifically, the attention
component introduces a new multi-layer perceptron based multi-head to generate
better non-linear feature mapping and representation than conventional
implementations such as dot-product. The propagation component considers not
only node features but also edge features, which differs from existing GNNs
that merely consider node features. The aggregation component uses a residual
connection to generate the final embedding. We evaluate the performance of GIPA
using the Open Graph Benchmark proteins (ogbn-proteins for short) dataset. The
experimental results reveal that GIPA can beat the state-of-the-art models in
terms of prediction accuracy, e.g., GIPA achieves an average test ROC-AUC of
$0.8700\pm 0.0010$ and outperforms all the previous methods listed in the

linking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at
both token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the
solutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.
This paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and
effective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,
we introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling
and entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we
design a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn
a richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language
Modeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction
tasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and
layout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at
segment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art
counterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and
EPHOIE datasets."

vulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to
trigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning
normally otherwise. Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous
data (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for
discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly
concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge
this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with
prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines
triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and
descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary;
input-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby
optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic
-- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or
fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for
both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph
classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of
security-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark
datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA.
We further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss
potential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions."

applications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of
finding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised
learning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
have recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The
underlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN)
for encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured
data in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is
followed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and
make an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution.
Recent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial
problems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed
model aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective
function. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a
classical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep
RL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard
problems. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that existing RL-based model may
not generalize to QAP."

methods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, Forests dominate
other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured,
so that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices.
However, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and
speech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks
(ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the
reason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature
magnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations
fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest
approach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random
matrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of
Networks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes
corresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one
can choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature
locality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live
on three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we
demonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show
superiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting
movement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions.
In all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF)

typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions
of edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training
GNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the
Deep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL
distributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings)
across the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational
decomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous
training approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include
non-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed
computations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph
partitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows
it to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations.
It further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using
sparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows
DistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency

from independent and identically distributed data to graph-structured data,
such as social networks, e-commerce user-item graphs, and knowledge graphs.
This evolution has led to the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that go
beyond the models existing data selection methods are designed for. Therefore,
we present Grain, an efficient framework that opens up a new perspective
through connecting data selection in GNNs with social influence maximization.
By exploiting the common patterns of GNNs, Grain introduces a novel feature

influence and diversity functions, and a greedy algorithm with an approximation
guarantee into a unified framework. Empirical studies on public datasets
demonstrate that Grain significantly improves both the performance and
efficiency of data selection (including active learning and core-set selection)

fundamentally important to support the success of deep neural network learning.
A direct computation of the landscape beyond two layers is hard. Therefore, to
capture the global view of the landscape, an interpretable model of the
network-parameter (or weight) space must be established. However, the model is
lacking so far. Furthermore, it remains unknown what the landscape looks like
for deep networks of binary synapses, which plays a key role in robust and
energy efficient neuromorphic computation. Here, we propose a statistical
mechanics framework by directly building a least structured model of the
high-dimensional weight space, considering realistic structured data,
stochastic gradient descent training, and the computational depth of neural
networks. We also consider whether the number of network parameters outnumbers
the number of supplied training data, namely, over- or under-parametrization.
Our least structured model reveals that the weight spaces of the
under-parametrization and over-parameterization cases belong to the same class,
in the sense that these weight spaces are well-connected without any
hierarchical clustering structure. In contrast, the shallow-network has a
broken weight space, characterized by a discontinuous phase transition, thereby
clarifying the benefit of depth in deep learning from the angle of high
dimensional geometry. Our effective model also reveals that inside a deep
network, there exists a liquid-like central part of the architecture in the
sense that the weights in this part behave as randomly as possible, providing
algorithmic implications. Our data-driven model thus provides a statistical

operation on point cloud remains indefinite due to its irregular data
structure. In this paper, we present Cubic Kernel Convolution (CKConv) that
learns to voxelize the features of local points by exploiting both continuous
and discrete convolutions. Our continuous convolution uniquely employs a 3D
cubic form of kernel weight representation that splits a feature into voxels in
embedding space. By consecutively applying discrete 3D convolutions on the
voxelized features in a spatial manner, preceding continuous convolution is
forced to learn spatial feature mapping, i.e., feature voxelization. In this
way, geometric information can be detailed by encoding with subdivided
features, and our 3D convolutions on these fixed structured data do not suffer
from discretization artifacts thanks to voxelization in embedding space.
Furthermore, we propose a spatial attention module, Local Set Attention (LSA),
to provide comprehensive structure awareness within the local point set and
hence produce representative features. By learning feature voxelization with
LSA, CKConv can extract enriched features for effective point cloud analysis.
We show that CKConv has great applicability to point cloud processing tasks

At the current stage of research, however, the efficient processing of GNNs is

formulation bounds the representational capacity of GNNs, and polynomial-time
GNNs are provably incapable of recognizing triangles in a graph. In this work,
we propose to augment the GNN message-passing operations with information
defined on ego graphs (i.e., the induced subgraph surrounding each node). We

enough on knowledge transfer since they do not make any adaptation for
downstream tasks. To solve such problems, we propose a new transfer learning
paradigm on GNNs which could effectively leverage self-supervised tasks as
auxiliary tasks to help the target task. Our methods would adaptively select
and combine different auxiliary tasks with the target task in the fine-tuning
stage. We design an adaptive auxiliary loss weighting model to learn the
weights of auxiliary tasks by quantifying the consistency between auxiliary
tasks and the target task. In addition, we learn the weighting model through
meta-learning. Our methods can be applied to various transfer learning
approaches, it performs well not only in multi-task learning but also in

fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph
inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function.
In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the
frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this

a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original
graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error,
while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order
proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a
complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant

space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also

performance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may
not produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is
that there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute
values in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be
easily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is
combinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore,
the deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also

transforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining
the interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross
feature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate
the interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model
cross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively.
Then during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used

augmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of
thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That
significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill
in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization
framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data
augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general
framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as
min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to

parameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular,
while intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of
augmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as
neuroscience signals. Moreover, label independent strategies might not be
suitable for such structured data and class-dependent augmentations might be
necessary. This idea has been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, while
it is quite intuitive: changing the color of a car image does not change the
object class to be predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange
does. This paper aims to increase the generalization power added through
class-wise data augmentation. Yet, as seeking transformations depending on the
class largely increases the complexity of the task, using gradient-free
optimization techniques as done by most existing automatic approaches becomes
intractable for real-world datasets. For this reason we propose to use
differentiable data augmentation amenable to gradient-based learning. EEG

interpretable representation of temporal graph signals?
  We propose a general, dictionary-based framework for temporal graph signal
decomposition (TGSD). The key idea is to learn a low-rank, joint encoding of
the data via a combination of graph and time dictionaries. We propose a highly
scalable decomposition algorithm for both complete and incomplete data, and
demonstrate its advantage for matrix decomposition, imputation of missing
values, temporal interpolation, clustering, period estimation, and rank
estimation in synthetic and real-world data ranging from traffic patterns to
social media activity. Our framework achieves 28% reduction in RMSE compared to
baselines for temporal interpolation when as many as 75% of the observations
are missing. It scales best among baselines taking under 20 seconds on 3.5
million data points and produces the most parsimonious models. To the best of
our knowledge, TGSD is the first framework to jointly model graph signals by
temporal and graph dictionaries."

small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat
and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models.
With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar
investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that
adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in
a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from
a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a
few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through
flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found
for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad
actors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them.
Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the
anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the
intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success
rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor
nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\% for GCN and other

a graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and
high-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the
graph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with
the proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art
performance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose
shrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds
high-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage

Although many such learning methods depend on the measurement of differences

remains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric
learning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named
interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a
subgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation
capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each
subgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can
provide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has
a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses
pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is
also proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is
guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our
pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show
that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and
sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a
transportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the
computational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several

features from spatio-temporal structures. Particularly, conventional models
such as convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks are incapable of
revealing the temporal patterns in short or long terms and exploring the
spatial properties in local or global scope from spatio-temporal graphs

temporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on
previous settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the

methods are generally adopted from traditional domain adaptation tasks, and the
properties of graph-structured data are not well utilized. For example, the
observed social networks on different platforms are controlled not only by the
different crowd or communities but also by the domain-specific policies and the
background noise. Based on these properties in graph-structured data, we first
assume that the graph-structured data generation process is controlled by three
independent types of latent variables, i.e., the semantic latent variables, the
domain latent variables, and the random latent variables. Based on this
assumption, we propose a disentanglement-based unsupervised domain adaptation
method for the graph-structured data, which applies variational graph
auto-encoders to recover these latent variables and disentangles them via three

content that can be processed in a stable manner by subsequent graph
convolutional filters. However, the exact shape of the frequency content
created by nonlinear functions is not known, and thus, it cannot be learned nor
controlled. In this work, node-variant graph filters (NVGFs) are shown to be
capable of creating frequency content and are thus used in lieu of nonlinear
activation functions. This results in a novel GNN architecture that, although
linear, is capable of creating frequency content as well. Furthermore, this new
frequency content can be either designed or learned from data. In this way, the
role of frequency creation is separated from the nonlinear nature of
traditional GNNs. Extensive simulations are carried out to differentiate the
contributions of frequency creation from those of the nonlinearity."

problems for network-structured data, aims to predict whether there exists a
link between two nodes. The traditional approaches are based on the explicit
similarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding
each node into a low-dimensional space. In order to efficiently handle the
intensive similarity computation in link prediction, the hashing technique has
been successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space.
However, the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from
the randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash
techniques in the embedding process. Currently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN)
framework has been widely applied to the graph-related tasks in an end-to-end
manner, but it commonly requires substantial computational resources and memory
costs due to massive parameter learning, which makes the GNN-based algorithms
impractical without the help of a powerful workhorse. In this paper, we propose
a simple and effective model called #GNN, which balances the trade-off between
accuracy and efficiency. #GNN is able to efficiently acquire node
representation in the Hamming space for link prediction by exploiting the
randomized hashing technique to implement message passing and capture
high-order proximity in the GNN framework. Furthermore, we characterize the
discriminative power of #GNN in probability. The extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed #GNN algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to
the learning-based algorithms and outperforms the randomized algorithm, while
running significantly faster than the learning-based algorithms. Also, the
proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability on a large-scale network with
the limited resources."

connectome. Although recent attempts to apply GNN to the FC network have shown
promising results, there is still a common limitation that they usually do not
incorporate the dynamic characteristics of the FC network which fluctuates over

input for the GNN reported a reduction in performance compared to static FC
methods, and did not provide temporal explainability. Here, we propose STAGIN,
a method for learning dynamic graph representation of the brain connectome with

different weight on the relational and textual attributes during the
anonymization process. We evaluate our approach with two real-world datasets

the context of a practically-motivated model problem: the depth acts as a
fitting resource, with larger depths corresponding to smoother networks that
can more readily separate the class manifolds, and the width acts as a
statistical resource, enabling concentration of the randomly-initialized
network and its gradients. The argument centers around the neural tangent
kernel and its role in the nonasymptotic analysis of training overparameterized
neural networks; to this literature, we contribute essentially optimal rates of
concentration for the neural tangent kernel of deep fully-connected networks,
requiring width $n \gtrsim L\,\mathrm{poly}(d_0)$ to achieve uniform

In this paper, we propose an attentional graph neural network based
parking-slot detection method, which refers the marking-points in an
around-view image as graph-structured data and utilize graph neural network to
aggregate the neighboring information between marking-points. Without any
manually designed post-processing, the proposed method is end-to-end trainable.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on public benchmark dataset, where

multi-scale frameworks for ordinary sequential data to a set-structured data is
nontrivial as it should be invariant to the permutation of its elements. In
this paper, we propose SetVAE, a hierarchical variational autoencoder for sets.
Motivated by recent progress in set encoding, we build SetVAE upon attentive
modules that first partition the set and project the partition back to the
original cardinality. Exploiting this module, our hierarchical VAE learns
latent variables at multiple scales, capturing coarse-to-fine dependency of the
set elements while achieving permutation invariance. We evaluate our model on
point cloud generation task and achieve competitive performance to the prior

capsules are established by identifying heterogeneous factors underlying each
node, such that their instantiation parameters represent different properties
of the same entity. To learn the hierarchical representation, HGCN
characterizes the part-whole relationship between lower-level capsules (part)

of GNNs. Although numerous works have been proposed to defend adversarial
attacks from various perspectives, most of them can be robust against the
attacks only on specific scenarios. To address this shortage of robust
generalization, we propose to defend the adversarial attacks on GNN through
applying the Spatio-Temporal sparsification (called ST-Sparse) on the GNN
hidden node representation. ST-Sparse is similar to the Dropout regularization
in spirit. Through intensive experiment evaluation with GCN as the target GNN
model, we identify the benefits of ST-Sparse as follows: (1) ST-Sparse shows
the defense performance improvement in most cases, as it can effectively
increase the robust accuracy by up to 6\% improvement; (2) ST-Sparse
illustrates its robust generalization capability by integrating with the
existing defense methods, similar to the integration of Dropout into various
deep learning models as a standard regularization technique; (3) ST-Sparse also
shows its ordinary generalization capability on clean datasets, in that
ST-SparseGCN (the integration of ST-Sparse and the original GCN) even

progress of graph learning. However, two disturbing factors, noise and
redundancy in graph data, and lack of interpretation for prediction results,
impede further development of GCN. One solution is to recognize a predictive
yet compressed subgraph to get rid of the noise and redundancy and obtain the
interpretable part of the graph. This setting of subgraph is similar to the
information bottleneck (IB) principle, which is less studied on
graph-structured data and GCN. Inspired by the IB principle, we propose a novel
subgraph information bottleneck (SIB) framework to recognize such subgraphs,
named IB-subgraph. However, the intractability of mutual information and the
discrete nature of graph data makes the objective of SIB notoriously hard to
optimize. To this end, we introduce a bilevel optimization scheme coupled with
a mutual information estimator for irregular graphs. Moreover, we propose a
continuous relaxation for subgraph selection with a connectivity loss for
stabilization. We further theoretically prove the error bound of our estimation
scheme for mutual information and the noise-invariant nature of IB-subgraph.
Extensive experiments on graph learning and large-scale point cloud tasks

leading to the so-called deep forests (DF) (Zhou \& Feng,2019). In this paper,
our aim is not to benchmark DF performances but to investigate instead their
underlying mechanisms. Additionally, DF architecture can be generally
simplified into more simple and computationally efficient shallow forest
networks. Despite some instability, the latter may outperform standard
predictive tree-based methods. We exhibit a theoretical framework in which a
shallow tree network is shown to enhance the performance of classical decision
trees. In such a setting, we provide tight theoretical lower and upper bounds

leverage both types of information. Conceptually, the representational
information provides guidance for the model to construct better node features;
while the correlational information indicates the correlation between node
outcomes conditional on node features. Through a simulation study, we find that
many popular GNN models are incapable of effectively utilizing the
correlational information. By leveraging the idea of the copula, a principled
way to describe the dependence among multivariate random variables, we offer a
general solution. The proposed Copula Graph Neural Network (CopulaGNN) can take
a wide range of GNN models as base models and utilize both representational and

118,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Graph Convolutional Neural Networks with Node Transition Probability-based Message Passing and DropNode Regularization,"Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have received much attention
recently, owing to their capability in handling graph-structured data. Among
the existing GCNNs, many methods can be viewed as instances of a neural message
passing motif; features of nodes are passed around their neighbors, aggregated
and transformed to produce better nodes' representations. Nevertheless, these
methods seldom use node transition probabilities, a measure that has been found
useful in exploring graphs. Furthermore, when the transition probabilities are
used, their transition direction is often improperly considered in the feature
aggregation step, resulting in an inefficient weighting scheme. In addition,
although a great number of GCNN models with increasing level of complexity have
been introduced, the GCNNs often suffer from over-fitting when being trained on
small graphs. Another issue of the GCNNs is over-smoothing, which tends to make
nodes' representations indistinguishable. This work presents a new method to
improve the message passing process based on node transition probabilities by
properly considering the transition direction, leading to a better weighting
scheme in nodes' features aggregation compared to the existing counterpart.
Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method termed DropNode to address
the over-fitting and over-smoothing issues simultaneously. DropNode randomly
discards part of a graph, thus it creates multiple deformed versions of the
graph, leading to data augmentation regularization effect. Additionally,
DropNode lessens the connectivity of the graph, mitigating the effect of
over-smoothing in deep GCNNs. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets

of training quantized GNNs, enabling the usage of low precision integer
arithmetic during inference. We identify the sources of error that uniquely
arise when attempting to quantize GNNs, and propose an architecturally-agnostic
method, Degree-Quant, to improve performance over existing quantization-aware
training baselines commonly used on other architectures, such as CNNs. We
validate our method on six datasets and show, unlike previous attempts, that
models generalize to unseen graphs. Models trained with Degree-Quant for INT8

set: an unordered collection of multiple objects, each object described by a
feature vector. Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide
variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs. Deep
learning has recently shown great success on other types of structured data, so
we aim to build the necessary structures for sets into deep neural networks.
  The first focus of this thesis is the learning of better set representations
(sets as input). Existing approaches have bottlenecks that prevent them from
properly modeling relations between objects within the set. To address this
issue, we develop a variety of techniques for different scenarios and show that
alleviating the bottleneck leads to consistent improvements across many
experiments.
  The second focus of this thesis is the prediction of sets (sets as output).
Current approaches do not take the unordered nature of sets into account
properly. We determine that this results in a problem that causes discontinuity
issues with many set prediction tasks and prevents them from learning some
extremely simple datasets. To avoid this problem, we develop two models that
properly take the structure of sets into account. Various experiments show that
our set prediction techniques can significantly benefit over existing

framework for learning representations from set-structured data, which is
rooted in the optimal mass transportation problem. In particular, we treat
elements of a set as samples from a probability measure and propose an exact
Euclidean embedding for Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) distances to learn

genuine node labels are always provided for training. However, there has been
very little research effort on how to improve the robustness of GNNs in the
presence of label noise. Learning with label noise has been primarily studied
in the context of image classification, but these techniques cannot be directly
applied to graph-structured data, due to two major challenges -- label sparsity
and label dependency -- faced by learning on graphs. In this paper, we propose
a new framework, UnionNET, for learning with noisy labels on graphs under a
semi-supervised setting. Our approach provides a unified solution for robustly
training GNNs and performing label correction simultaneously. The key idea is
to perform label aggregation to estimate node-level class probability
distributions, which are used to guide sample reweighting and label correction.
Compared with existing works, UnionNET has two appealing advantages. First, it
requires no extra clean supervision, or explicit estimation of the noise
transition matrix. Second, a unified learning framework is proposed to robustly
train GNNs in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that our proposed
approach: (1) is effective in improving model robustness against different

we present a generic model for incremental editing of structured data (i.e.,
""structural edits""). Particularly, we focus on tree-structured data, taking
abstract syntax trees of computer programs as our canonical example. Our editor
learns to iteratively generate tree edits (e.g., deleting or adding a subtree)
and applies them to the partially edited data, thereby the entire editing
process can be formulated as consecutive, incremental tree transformations. To
show the unique benefits of modeling tree edits directly, we further propose a
novel edit encoder for learning to represent edits, as well as an imitation
learning method that allows the editor to be more robust. We evaluate our
proposed editor on two source code edit datasets, where results show that, with
the proposed edit encoder, our editor significantly improves accuracy over
previous approaches that generate the edited program directly in one pass.
Finally, we demonstrate that training our editor to imitate experts and correct

this work, we demonstrate these characterizations by studying the Gaussian
Process Kernel (GPK) and Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) of an
infinitely-wide GCN, corresponding to the analysis on expressivity and
trainability, respectively. We first prove the expressivity of infinitely-wide
GCNs decaying at an exponential rate by applying the mean-field theory on GPK.
Besides, we formulate the asymptotic behaviors of GNTK in the large depth,
which enables us to reveal the dropping trainability of wide and deep GCNs at
an exponential rate. Additionally, we extend our theoretical framework to

assumptions fail when the cardinality of the set is prohibitively large such
that we cannot even load the set into memory. In more extreme cases, the set
size could be potentially unlimited, and the elements of the set could be given
in a streaming manner, where the model receives subsets of the full set data at
irregular intervals. To tackle such practical challenges in large-scale set
encoding, we go beyond the usual constraints of invariance and equivariance and
introduce a new property termed Mini-Batch Consistency that is required for
large scale mini-batch set encoding. We present a scalable and efficient set
encoding mechanism that is amenable to mini-batch processing with respect to
set elements and capable of updating set representations as more data arrives.
The proposed method respects the required symmetries of invariance and

the attention is a product of two parts: 1) the RBF kernel to measure the
similarity of two instances and 2) the exponential of $L^{2}$ norm to compute
the importance of individual instances. From this decomposition, we generalize
the attention in three ways. First, we propose implicit kernel attention with
an implicit kernel function instead of manual kernel selection. Second, we

vertex-enrichment can significantly improve the performance of a GNN. That is,
the performance VEGNNs is significantly better than GNNs across all GNN

analysis of apartment floor plans on online real estate platforms can enhance
hedonic rent price appraisal. We propose a tailored two-staged deep learning
approach to learn price-relevant designs of floor plans from historical price
data. Subsequently, we integrate the floor plan predictions into hedonic rent
price models that account for both structural and locational characteristics of
an apartment. Our empirical analysis based on a unique dataset of 9174 real
estate listings suggests that current hedonic models underutilize the available
data. We find that (1) the visual design of floor plans has significant
explanatory power regarding rent prices - even after controlling for structural
and locational apartment characteristics, and (2) harnessing floor plans
results in an up to 10.56% lower out-of-sample prediction error. We further
find that floor plans yield a particularly high gain in prediction performance
for older and smaller apartments. Altogether, our empirical findings contribute

learning in graph structured data. However, how to enable the attention
mechanisms in GATs to smoothly consider both structural and feature information

Networks (JATs) to address the aforementioned challenge. Different from
previous attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs), JATs adopt novel joint
attention mechanisms which can automatically determine the relative
significance between node features and structural coefficients learned from
graph topology, when computing the attention scores. Therefore, representations
concerning more structural properties can be inferred by JATs. Besides, we
theoretically analyze the expressive power of JATs and further propose an
improved strategy for the joint attention mechanisms that enables JATs to reach
the upper bound of expressive power which every message-passing GNN can
ultimately achieve, i.e., 1-WL test. JATs can thereby be seen as most powerful
message-passing GNNs. The proposed neural architecture has been extensively
tested on widely used benchmarking datasets, and has been compared with
state-of-the-art GNNs for various downstream predictive tasks. Experimental
results show that JATs achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the testing

DAGNN, an architecture that processes information according to the flow defined

manifold by exploiting their continuous piecewise affine structure. Our
reformulation of AEs provides new insights into their mapping, reconstruction
guarantees, as well as an interpretation of commonly used regularization
techniques. We leverage these findings to derive two new regularizations that
enable AEs to capture the inherent symmetry in the data. Our regularizations
leverage recent advances in the group of transformation learning to enable AEs
to better approximate the data manifold without explicitly defining the group
underlying the manifold. Under the assumption that the symmetry of the data can
be explained by a Lie group, we prove that the regularizations ensure the

fundamental part of GNNs. Although most of GNNs basically follow a message
passing manner, litter effort has been made to discover and analyze their
essential relations. In this paper, we establish a surprising connection
between different propagation mechanisms with a unified optimization problem,
showing that despite the proliferation of various GNNs, in fact, their proposed
propagation mechanisms are the optimal solution optimizing a feature fitting

Our proposed unified optimization framework, summarizing the commonalities
between several of the most representative GNNs, not only provides a
macroscopic view on surveying the relations between different GNNs, but also
further opens up new opportunities for flexibly designing new GNNs. With the
proposed framework, we discover that existing works usually utilize naive graph
convolutional kernels for feature fitting function, and we further develop two
novel objective functions considering adjustable graph kernels showing low-pass

Choosing a promising architecture for constructing GNNs can be transferred to a
hyperparameter optimisation problem, a very challenging task due to the size of
the underlying search space and high computational cost for evaluating
candidate GNNs. To address this issue, this research presents a novel genetic
algorithm with a hierarchical evaluation strategy (HESGA), which combines the
full evaluation of GNNs with a fast evaluation approach. By using full
evaluation, a GNN is represented by a set of hyperparameter values and trained
on a specified dataset, and root mean square error (RMSE) will be used to
measure the quality of the GNN represented by the set of hyperparameter values
(for regression problems). While in the proposed fast evaluation process, the
training will be interrupted at an early stage, the difference of RMSE values
between the starting and interrupted epochs will be used as a fast score, which
implies the potential of the GNN being considered. To coordinate both types of
evaluations, the proposed hierarchical strategy uses the fast evaluation in a
lower level for recommending candidates to a higher level, where the full
evaluation will act as a final assessor to maintain a group of elite
individuals. To validate the effectiveness of HESGA, we apply it to optimise
two types of deep graph neural networks. The experimental results on three

capable of generating novel and perceptually realistic signals (e.g., images
and sound waves). With the emergence of deep models for graph structured data,
natural interests seek extensions of these generative models for graphs.
Successful extensions were seen recently in the case of learning from a
collection of graphs (e.g., protein data banks), but the learning from a single
graph has been largely under explored. The latter case, however, is important
in practice. For example, graphs in financial and healthcare systems contain so
much confidential information that their public accessibility is nearly
impossible, but open science in these fields can only advance when similar data
are available for benchmarking.
  In this work, we propose an approach to generating a doppelganger graph that
resembles a given one in many graph properties but nonetheless can hardly be
used to reverse engineer the original one, in the sense of a near zero edge
overlap. The approach is an orchestration of graph representation learning,
generative adversarial networks, and graph realization algorithms. Through
comparison with several graph generative models (either parameterized by neural
networks or not), we demonstrate that our result barely reproduces the given
graph but closely matches its properties. We further show that downstream
tasks, such as node classification, on the generated graphs reach similar
performance to the use of the original ones."

proven to be effective in wide-ranging applications, from bioinformatics to
social networks to computer vision. However, random walk kernels generally
suffer from slowness and tottering, an effect which causes walks to
overemphasize local graph topology, undercutting the importance of global
structure. To correct for these issues, we recast return probability graph
kernels under the more general framework of density of states -- a framework
which uses the lens of spectral analysis to uncover graph motifs and properties
hidden within the interior of the spectrum -- and use our interpretation to
construct scalable, composite density of states based graph kernels which
balance local and global information, leading to higher classification

attention networks, namely EGATs, to extend the use of graph neural networks to
those tasks learning on graphs with both node and edge features. These models
can be regarded as extensions of graph attention networks (GATs). By reforming
the model structure and the learning process, the new models can accept node

The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph
auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational
structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to
augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for
semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn
differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure.
However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly
little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap
between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization
models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods
for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work.
Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which
generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g.
GraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and
unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc)
into a single consistent approach. To illustrate the generality of this
approach, we fit over thirty existing methods into this framework. We believe

conventional GCN models that carry out node-based attentions within each layer,
the proposed SPAGAN conducts path-based attention that explicitly accounts for
the influence of a sequence of nodes yielding the minimum cost, or shortest
path, between the center node and its higher-order neighbors. SPAGAN therefore

of all nodes but labels of a few nodes. The classical label propagation (LP)
method and the emerging graph convolutional network (GCN) are two popular
semi-supervised solutions to this problem. The LP method is not effective in
modeling node attributes and labels jointly or facing a slow convergence rate
on large-scale graphs. GraphHop is proposed to its shortcoming. With proper
initial label vector embeddings, each iteration of GraphHop contains two steps:
1) label aggregation and 2) label update. In Step 1, each node aggregates its
neighbors' label vectors obtained in the previous iteration. In Step 2, a new
label vector is predicted for each node based on the label of the node itself
and the aggregated label information obtained in Step 1. This iterative
procedure exploits the neighborhood information and enables GraphHop to perform
well in an extremely small label rate setting and scale well for very large
graphs. Experimental results show that GraphHop outperforms state-of-the-art

and add non-lineality. To tackle this problem, we investigate the expressive
power of graph NNs via their asymptotic behaviors as the layer size tends to
infinity. Our strategy is to generalize the forward propagation of a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN), which is a popular graph NN variant, as a specific
dynamical system. In the case of a GCN, we show that when its weights satisfy
the conditions determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized
Laplacian, its output exponentially approaches the set of signals that carry
information of the connected components and node degrees only for
distinguishing nodes. Our theory enables us to relate the expressive power of
GCNs with the topological information of the underlying graphs inherent in the
graph spectra. To demonstrate this, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of
GCNs on the Erd\H{o}s -- R\'{e}nyi graph. We show that when the Erd\H{o}s --
R\'{e}nyi graph is sufficiently dense and large, a broad range of GCNs on it
suffers from the ""information loss"" in the limit of infinite layers with high
probability. Based on the theory, we provide a principled guideline for weight

they provide huge convenience for passengers. As a fundamental problem, the
timely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for
effective traffic flow control and route planning. As both spatial and temporal
patterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has
evolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modeling historical
passenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot
by connecting region nodes via different relational edges (e.g.,
origin-destination relationship, geographical distance, etc.). Consequently,
the spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in
the constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about
the directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two
connected regions. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to
simultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed, and
weighted (DDW) graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph
representations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel
spatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with
all attention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those
three intrinsic properties of DDW graphs, we build three attention layers to
fully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across

with greater numbers of message-passing steps. Spectral approaches use
eigendecompositions of the graph Laplacian to produce a generalization of
spatial convolutions to graph structured data which access information over
short and long time scales simultaneously. Here we introduce the Spectral Graph
Network, which applies message passing to both the spatial and spectral
domains. Our model projects vertices of the spatial graph onto the Laplacian
eigenvectors, which are each represented as vertices in a fully connected
""spectral graph"", and then applies learned message passing to them. We apply
this model to various benchmark tasks including a graph-based variant of MNIST
classification, molecular property prediction on MoleculeNet and QM9, and
shortest path problems on random graphs. Our results show that the Spectral GN

technique into the fusion architecture to generate a robust binary multimodal
shared latent representation. Further, we employ a hybrid secure architecture
by combining cancelable biometrics with secure sketch techniques and integrate

forge a combination of multiple biometrics that pass the authentication. The
efficacy of the proposed approach is shown using a multimodal database of face

outliers, for robust model fitting. Instead of analyzing the information of
each data point or each model hypothesis independently, we formulate the
consensus information and the preference information as a hierarchical
representation to alleviate the sensitivity to gross outliers. Specifically, we
firstly construct a hierarchical representation, which consists of a model
hypothesis layer and a data point layer. The model hypothesis layer is used to
remove insignificant model hypotheses and the data point layer is used to
remove gross outliers. Then, based on the hierarchical representation, we
propose an effective hierarchical message propagation (HMP) algorithm and an
improved affinity propagation (IAP) algorithm to prune insignificant vertices

model the flood, but instead, rely on the prediction of hydrodynamic conditions
at the coast and on expert judgment. Recent scientific contributions are now
capable to precisely model flood events, even in situations where wave
overtopping plays a significant role. Such models are nevertheless
costly-to-evaluate and surrogate ones need to be exploited for substantial
computational savings. For the latter models, the hydro-meteorological forcing
conditions (inputs) or flood events (outputs) are conveniently parametrised
into scalar representations. However, they neglect the fact that inputs are
actually functions (more precisely, time series), and that floods spatially
propagate inland. Here, we introduce a multi-output Gaussian process model
accounting for both criteria. On various examples, we test its versatility for
both learning spatial maps and inferring unobserved ones. We demonstrate that
efficient implementations are obtained by considering tensor-structured data
and/or sparse-variational approximations. Finally, the proposed framework is
applied on a coastal application aiming at predicting flood events. We conclude
that accurate predictions are obtained in the order of minutes rather than the
couples of days required by dedicated hydrodynamic simulators."

for deep learning models as well as for traditional models. Traditionally
successful countermeasures such as synthetic over-sampling have had limited
success with complex, structured data handled by deep learning models. In this
work, we propose to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) equipped with a
generator network G, a discriminator network D and a classifier network C to
remove the class-imbalance in visual data sets. The generator network is
initialized with auto-encoder to make it stable. The discriminator D ensures
that G adheres to class distribution of imbalanced class. In conventional
methods, where Generator G competes with discriminator D in a min-max game, we
propose to further add an additional classifier network to the original
network. Now, the generator network tries to compete in a min-max game with
Discriminator as well as the new classifier that we have introduced. An
additional condition is enforced on generator network G to produce points in
the convex hull of desired imbalanced class. Further the contention of
adversarial game with classifier C, pushes conditional distribution learned by
G towards the periphery of the respective class, compensating the problem of
class imbalance. Experimental evidence shows that this initialization results
in stable training of the network. We achieve state of the art performance on

adversarial ones that inject false data into models. They negatively impact the
learning process, with no benefit to deeper networks, as they degrade a model's
accuracy and convergence rates. In this paper, we propose an
attack-agnostic-based defense method for mitigating their influence. In it, a
Defensive Feature Layer (DFL) is integrated with a well-known DNN architecture
which assists in neutralizing the effects of illegitimate perturbation samples
in the feature space. To boost the robustness and trustworthiness of this
method for correctly classifying attacked input samples, we regularize the
hidden space of a trained model with a discriminative loss function called
Polarized Contrastive Loss (PCL). It improves discrimination among samples in
different classes and maintains the resemblance of those in the same class.
Also, we integrate a DFL and PCL in a compact model for defending against data
poisoning attacks. This method is trained and tested using the CIFAR-10 and

theory of deep learning. The types of data where these networks are most
successful, such as images or sequences of speech, are characterised by
intricate correlations. Yet, most theoretical work on neural networks does not
explicitly model training data, or assumes that elements of each data sample
are drawn independently from some factorised probability distribution. These
approaches are thus by construction blind to the correlation structure of
real-world data sets and their impact on learning in neural networks. Here, we
introduce a generative model for structured data sets that we call the hidden
manifold model (HMM). The idea is to construct high-dimensional inputs that lie
on a lower-dimensional manifold, with labels that depend only on their position
within this manifold, akin to a single layer decoder or generator in a
generative adversarial network. We demonstrate that learning of the hidden
manifold model is amenable to an analytical treatment by proving a ""Gaussian
Equivalence Property"" (GEP), and we use the GEP to show how the dynamics of
two-layer neural networks trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent is
captured by a set of integro-differential equations that track the performance
of the network at all times. This permits us to analyse in detail how a neural
network learns functions of increasing complexity during training, how its

structured cross-validation (CV), which leaves out some data subset (such as
data within a time interval or data in a geographic region) in each fold. But
CV here can be prohibitively slow due to the need to re-run already-expensive
learning algorithms many times. Previous work has shown approximate
cross-validation (ACV) methods provide a fast and provably accurate alternative
in the setting of empirical risk minimization. But this existing ACV work is
restricted to simpler models by the assumptions that (i) data across CV folds
are independent and (ii) an exact initial model fit is available. In structured
data analyses, both these assumptions are often untrue. In the present work, we
address (i) by extending ACV to CV schemes with dependence structure between

means that GCN models may suffer malicious attacks with unnoticeable
modifications of the data. Among all the adversarial attacks on GCNs, there is
a special kind of attack method called the universal adversarial attack, which
generates a perturbation that can be applied to any sample and causes GCN
models to output incorrect results. Although universal adversarial attacks in
computer vision have been extensively researched, there are few research works
on universal adversarial attacks on graph structured data. In this paper, we
propose a targeted universal adversarial attack against GCNs. Our method
employs a few nodes as the attack nodes. The attack capability of the attack
nodes is enhanced through a small number of fake nodes connected to them.
During an attack, any victim node will be misclassified by the GCN as the
attack node class as long as it is linked to them. The experiments on three
popular datasets show that the average attack success rate of the proposed
attack on any victim node in the graph reaches 83% when using only 3 attack

learn graph representation without negative examples in an unsupervised manner.
In addition, we summarize three kinds of augmentation methods for

extending recent works that examine their power in graph isomorphism testing

Information Bottleneck (IB), GIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient
representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between
the representation and the target, and simultaneously constraining the mutual
information between the representation and the input data. Different from the

We design two sampling algorithms for structural regularization and instantiate

attacker pretending as a client. Unfortunately, existing works focus on the
models trained on the Euclidean space, e.g., images and texts, while how to
extract a GNN model that contains a graph structure and node features is yet to

in the context of GNN model extraction and classify the adversarial threats
into seven categories by considering different background knowledge of the
attacker, e.g., attributes and/or neighbor connectives of the attacker nodes.
Then we present the detailed methods which utilize the accessible knowledge in

196,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Neuralizing Efficient Higher-order Belief Propagation,"Graph neural network models have been extensively used to learn node
representations for graph structured data in an end-to-end setting. These
models often rely on localized first order approximations of spectral graph
convolutions and hence are unable to capture higher-order relational
information between nodes. Probabilistic Graphical Models form another class of
models that provide rich flexibility in incorporating such relational
information but are limited by inefficient approximate inference algorithms at
higher order. In this paper, we propose to combine these approaches to learn
better node and graph representations. First, we derive an efficient
approximate sum-product loopy belief propagation inference algorithm for
higher-order PGMs. We then embed the message passing updates into a neural
network to provide the inductive bias of the inference algorithm in end-to-end
learning. This gives us a model that is flexible enough to accommodate domain
knowledge while maintaining the computational advantage. We further propose
methods for constructing higher-order factors that are conditioned on node and
edge features and share parameters wherever necessary. Our experimental
evaluation shows that our model indeed captures higher-order information,
substantially outperforming state-of-the-art $k$-order graph neural networks in
molecular datasets."

automated decisions made by models in high-stake domains. Organizations that
employ these models may also need to satisfy regulations that promote
responsible and ethical A.I. While fairness metrics relying on comparing model
error rates across subpopulations have been widely investigated for the
detection and mitigation of bias, fairness in terms of the equalized ability to
achieve recourse for different protected attribute groups has been relatively
unexplored. We present a novel formulation for training neural networks that
considers the distance of data points to the decision boundary such that the
new objective: (1) reduces the average distance to the decision boundary
between two groups for individuals subject to a negative outcome in each group,
i.e. the network is more fair with respect to the ability to obtain recourse,
and (2) increases the average distance of data points to the boundary to
promote adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that training with this loss
yields more fair and robust neural networks with similar accuracies to models
trained without it. Moreover, we qualitatively motivate and empirically show
that reducing recourse disparity across groups also improves fairness measures
that rely on error rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that recourse capabilities across groups are considered to train fairer neural
networks, and a relation between error rates based fairness and recourse based
fairness is investigated."

this work, we exploit the deep conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and
we define an original loss function together with a metric that targets
hierarchically structured data AD. Our motivating application is a real world

applications, the relationships between objects are in higher-order, beyond a
pairwise formulation. To efficiently learn deep embeddings on the high-order
graph-structured data, we introduce two end-to-end trainable operators to the
family of graph neural networks, i.e., hypergraph convolution and hypergraph
attention. Whilst hypergraph convolution defines the basic formulation of
performing convolution on a hypergraph, hypergraph attention further enhances
the capacity of representation learning by leveraging an attention module. With
the two operators, a graph neural network is readily extended to a more
flexible model and applied to diverse applications where non-pairwise

real-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven
to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a
hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information
propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges.
Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for
use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads
to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's
expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework
that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and
efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of
HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information.
Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach,
inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be
used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as
evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation,
we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods

former normally uses feed-forward networks to transform features, while the
latter aggregates the transformed features over the graph. Numerous recent
works have proposed GNN models with different designs in the aggregation
operation. In this work, we establish mathematically that the aggregation
processes in a group of representative GNN models including GCN, GAT, PPNP, and
APPNP can be regarded as (approximately) solving a graph denoising problem with
a smoothness assumption. Such a unified view across GNNs not only provides a
new perspective to understand a variety of aggregation operations but also

performance degradation. In this work, we propose Uncertainty Matching GNN
(UM-GNN), that is aimed at improving the robustness of GNN models, particularly
against poisoning attacks to the graph structure, by leveraging epistemic
uncertainties from the message passing framework. More specifically, we propose
to build a surrogate predictor that does not directly access the graph
structure, but systematically extracts reliable knowledge from a standard GNN
through a novel uncertainty-matching strategy. Interestingly, this uncoupling
makes UM-GNN immune to evasion attacks by design, and achieves significantly
improved robustness against poisoning attacks. Using empirical studies with
standard benchmarks and a suite of global and target attacks, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of UM-GNN, when compared to existing baselines including the

explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the
complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we
propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear
feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation
framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph
of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate
a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute
the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using
HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of

emerged as a new promising paradigm to process graph-structured data. GNNs are
usually stacked to multiple layers and the node representations in each layer
are computed through propagating and aggregating the neighboring node features
with respect to the graph. By stacking to multiple layers, GNNs are able to
capture the long-range dependencies among the data on the graph and thus bring
performance improvements. To train a GNN with multiple layers effectively, some
normalization techniques (e.g., node-wise normalization, batch-wise
normalization) are necessary. However, the normalization techniques for GNNs
are highly task-relevant and different application tasks prefer to different
normalization techniques, which is hard to know in advance. To tackle this
deficiency, in this paper, we propose to learn graph normalization by
optimizing a weighted combination of normalization techniques at four different
levels, including node-wise normalization, adjacency-wise normalization,
graph-wise normalization, and batch-wise normalization, in which the
adjacency-wise normalization and the graph-wise normalization are newly
proposed in this paper to take into account the local structure and the global
structure on the graph, respectively. By learning the optimal weights, we are
able to automatically select a single best or a best combination of multiple
normalizations for a specific task. We conduct extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets for different tasks, including node classification, link

selection step in using Euclidean or learned similarity measure between
vectorized training and testing brain networks. Such sample connectomic
representation might include irrelevant and redundant features that could
mislead the training sample selection step. Undoubtedly, this fails to exploit
and preserve the topology of the brain connectome. To overcome this major
drawback, we propose Residual Embedding Similarity-Based Network selection
(RESNets) for predicting brain network evolution trajectory from a single
timepoint. RESNets first learns a compact geometric embedding of each training
and testing sample using adversarial connectome embedding network. This nicely
reduces the high-dimensionality of brain networks while preserving their
topological properties via graph convolutional networks. Next, to compute the
similarity between subjects, we introduce the concept of a connectional brain
template (CBT), a fixed network reference, where we further represent each
training and testing network as a deviation from the reference CBT in the
embedding space. As such, we select the most similar training subjects to the
testing subject at baseline by comparing their learned residual embeddings with
respect to the pre-defined CBT. Once the best training samples are selected at

forests to date fail to consume raw structured data such as text, or learn
effective representations for them, a factor behind the success of deep neural
networks in recent years. While there exist methods that construct smoothed

decision forests in name only: They are no longer axis-aligned, use stochastic
decisions, or are not interpretable. Furthermore, none of the existing methods
are appropriate for problems that require a Transfer Learning treatment. In
this work, we present a novel but intuitive proposal to achieve representation
learning for decision forests without imposing new restrictions or
necessitating structural changes. Our model is simply a decision forest,
possibly trained using any forest learning algorithm, atop a deep neural
network. By approximating the gradients of the decision forest through input
perturbation, a purely analytical procedure, the decision forest directs the
neural network to learn or fine-tune representations. Our framework has the
advantage that it is applicable to any arbitrary decision forest and that it

also boosts the generative ability of VGAE. We consider EVGAE to consist of
multiple sparse VGAE models, called epitomes, that are groups of latent
variables sharing the latent space. This approach aids in increasing active

question. Existing AL algorithms on graphs attempt to reuse the classic AL
query strategies designed for non-related data. However, they suffer from two
major limitations. First, different AL query strategies calculated in distinct
scoring spaces are often naively combined to determine which nodes to be
labelled. Second, the AL query engine and the learning of the classifier are
treated as two separating processes, resulting in unsatisfactory performance.
In this paper, we propose a SEmi-supervised Adversarial active Learning (SEAL)
framework on attributed graphs, which fully leverages the representation power
of deep neural networks and devises a novel AL query strategy in an adversarial
way. Our framework learns two adversarial components: a graph embedding network
that encodes both the unlabelled and labelled nodes into a latent space,
expecting to trick the discriminator to regard all nodes as already labelled,
and a semi-supervised discriminator network that distinguishes the unlabelled
from the existing labelled nodes in the latent space. The divergence score,
generated by the discriminator in a unified latent space, serves as the
informativeness measure to actively select the most informative node to be
labelled by an oracle. The two adversarial components form a closed loop to
mutually and simultaneously reinforce each other towards enhancing the active
learning performance. Extensive experiments on four real-world networks

ability to model the irregular data, e.g., skeletal data in human action
recognition, providing an exciting new way to fuse rich structural information
for nodes residing in different parts of a graph. In human action recognition,
current works introduce a dynamic graph generation mechanism to better capture
the underlying semantic skeleton connections and thus improves the performance.
In this paper, we provide an orthogonal way to explore the underlying
connections. Instead of introducing an expensive dynamic graph generation
paradigm, we build a more efficient GCN on a Riemann manifold, which we think
is a more suitable space to model the graph data, to make the extracted
representations fit the embedding matrix. Specifically, we present a novel
spatial-temporal GCN (ST-GCN) architecture which is defined via the Poincar\'e
geometry such that it is able to better model the latent anatomy of the
structure data. To further explore the optimal projection dimension in the
Riemann space, we mix different dimensions on the manifold and provide an
efficient way to explore the dimension for each ST-GCN layer. With the final
resulted architecture, we evaluate our method on two current largest scale 3D
datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120. The comparison results show that
the model could achieve a superior performance under any given evaluation
metrics with only 40\% model size when compared with the previous best GCN
method, which proves the effectiveness of our model."

flattened activation vectors. Despite empirical success, this approach has
notable drawbacks. Flattening followed by fully connected layers discards
multilinear structure in the activations and requires many parameters. We
address these problems by incorporating tensor algebraic operations that
preserve multilinear structure at every layer. First, we introduce Tensor
Contraction Layers (TCLs) that reduce the dimensionality of their input while
preserving their multilinear structure using tensor contraction. Next, we
introduce Tensor Regression Layers (TRLs), which express outputs through a
low-rank multilinear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to an output
tensor of arbitrary order. We learn the contraction and regression factors
end-to-end, and produce accurate nets with fewer parameters. Additionally, our
layers regularize networks by imposing low-rank constraints on the activations
(TCL) and regression weights (TRL). Experiments on ImageNet show that, applied
to VGG and ResNet architectures, TCLs and TRLs reduce the number of parameters
compared to fully connected layers by more than 65% while maintaining or
increasing accuracy. In addition to the space savings, our approach's ability
to leverage topological structure can be crucial for structured data such as

large data sets and batch sizes. In this paper, we present a general
hierarchical framework based on bandit algorithms to scale active search to
large batch sizes by maximizing information derived from the unique structure
of each dataset. Our hierarchical framework, Hierarchical Batch Bandit Search
(HBBS), strategically distributes batch selection across a learned embedding
space by facilitating wide exploration of different structural elements within
a dataset. We focus our application of HBBS on modern biology, where large
batch experimentation is often fundamental to the research process, and
demonstrate batch design of biological sequences (protein and DNA). We also
present a new Gym environment to easily simulate diverse biological sequences

the parameters space size, decoupling it from its strict relation with the size
of the hidden encoding space. By this means, we can effectively regulate the
trade-off between expressivity of the encoding, controlled by the hidden size,
computational complexity and model generalisation, influenced by
parameterisation. Finally, we introduce a new Tensorial Tree-LSTM derived as an
instance of our framework and we use it to experimentally assess our working
hypotheses on tree classification scenarios."

generalize successful deep neural architectures to non-Euclidean structured
data. Such methods have shown promising results on a broad spectrum of
applications ranging from social science, biomedicine, and particle physics to
computer vision, graphics, and chemistry. One of the limitations of the
majority of the current graph neural network architectures is that they are
often restricted to the transductive setting and rely on the assumption that
the underlying graph is known and fixed. In many settings, such as those
arising in medical and healthcare applications, this assumption is not
necessarily true since the graph may be noisy, partially- or even completely
unknown, and one is thus interested in inferring it from the data. This is
especially important in inductive settings when dealing with nodes not present
in the graph at training time. Furthermore, sometimes such a graph itself may
convey insights that are even more important than the downstream task. In this
paper, we introduce Differentiable Graph Module (DGM), a learnable function
predicting the edge probability in the graph relevant for the task, that can be
combined with convolutional graph neural network layers and trained in an
end-to-end fashion. We provide an extensive evaluation of applications from the
domains of healthcare (disease prediction), brain imaging (gender and age

of the constraints of HE, such as its inability to evaluate non-polynomial

In this work, we propose an alternative framework for generative modeling that
is simpler, easier to train, and deterministic, yet has many of the advantages
of VAEs. We observe that sampling a stochastic encoder in a Gaussian VAE can be
interpreted as simply injecting noise into the input of a deterministic
decoder. We investigate how substituting this kind of stochasticity, with other
explicit and implicit regularization schemes, can lead to an equally smooth and
meaningful latent space without forcing it to conform to an arbitrarily chosen
prior. To retrieve a generative mechanism to sample new data, we introduce an
ex-post density estimation step that can be readily applied also to existing
VAEs, improving their sample quality. We show, in a rigorous empirical study,
that the proposed regularized deterministic autoencoders are able to generate
samples that are comparable to, or better than, those of VAEs and more powerful

GNN model for graph classification, the graphs in the training set are usually
assumed to be identically distributed. However, in many real-world

to capture structural information: a node's feature vector is recursively
computed by aggregating features of its neighboring nodes. However, most of
aggregation schemes treat all connections in a graph equally, ignoring node
feature similarities. In this paper, we re-interpret node aggregation from the
perspective of kernel weighting, and present a framework to consider feature
similarity in an aggregation scheme. Specifically, we show that normalized
adjacency matrix is equivalent to a neighbor-based kernel matrix in a Krein
Space. We then propose feature aggregation as the composition of the original

a feature space. We further show how the proposed method can be extended to

representational properties of the GNN that adopts the attention mechanism as
an aggregator. Our analysis determines all cases when those attention-based
GNNs can always fail to distinguish certain distinct structures. Those cases
appear due to the ignorance of cardinality information in attention-based

way of interacting with paintings and statues still remains taking pictures.
Yet images alone can only convey the aesthetics of the artwork, lacking is
information which is often required to fully understand and appreciate it.
Usually this additional knowledge comes both from the artwork itself (and
therefore the image depicting it) and from an external source of knowledge,
such as an information sheet. While the former can be inferred by computer
vision algorithms, the latter needs more structured data to pair visual content

detection. Considering the success of hyperbolic representations of
graph-structured data in last years, an ongoing challenge is to set up a
hyperbolic approach for the community detection problem. The present paper
meets this challenge by introducing a Riemannian equivalent of \textit{ComE}.
Our proposed approach combines hyperbolic embeddings with Riemannian K-means or
Riemannian mixture models to perform community detection. We illustrate the
usefulness of this framework through several experiments on real-world social
networks and comparisons with \textit{ComE} and recent hyperbolic-based

285,"['cs.LG', 'cs.SI', 'stat.ML']",Tree++: Truncated Tree Based Graph Kernels,"Graph-structured data arise ubiquitously in many application domains. A
fundamental problem is to quantify their similarities. Graph kernels are often
used for this purpose, which decompose graphs into substructures and compare
these substructures. However, most of the existing graph kernels do not have
the property of scale-adaptivity, i.e., they cannot compare graphs at multiple
levels of granularities. Many real-world graphs such as molecules exhibit
structure at varying levels of granularities. To tackle this problem, we
propose a new graph kernel called Tree++ in this paper. At the heart of Tree++
is a graph kernel called the path-pattern graph kernel. The path-pattern graph
kernel first builds a truncated BFS tree rooted at each vertex and then uses
paths from the root to every vertex in the truncated BFS tree as features to
represent graphs. The path-pattern graph kernel can only capture graph
similarity at fine granularities. In order to capture graph similarity at
coarse granularities, we incorporate a new concept called super path into it.
The super path contains truncated BFS trees rooted at the vertices in a path.
Our evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that Tree++
achieves the best classification accuracy compared with previous graph kernels."

representation learning on graphs in a variety of real-world applications.
However, two fundamental weaknesses of MPNNs' aggregators limit their ability
to represent graph-structured data: losing the structural information of nodes
in neighborhoods and lacking the ability to capture long-range dependencies in
disassortative graphs. Few studies have noticed the weaknesses from different
perspectives. From the observations on classical neural network and network
geometry, we propose a novel geometric aggregation scheme for graph neural
networks to overcome the two weaknesses. The behind basic idea is the
aggregation on a graph can benefit from a continuous space underlying the
graph. The proposed aggregation scheme is permutation-invariant and consists of
three modules, node embedding, structural neighborhood, and bi-level
aggregation. We also present an implementation of the scheme in graph
convolutional networks, termed Geom-GCN (Geometric Graph Convolutional
Networks), to perform transductive learning on graphs. Experimental results

learning a metric from structured data. Existing algorithms tackle the problem
in an asymmetric way, by either extracting vectorized summaries of the graph
structure or adding hard constraints to feature-space algorithms. Following a
different path, we define a metric regression scheme where we train
metric-constrained linear combinations of dissimilarity matrices. The idea is
that the input matrices can be pre-computed dissimilarity measures obtained
from any kind of available data (e.g. node attributes or edge structure). As
the model inputs are distance measures, we do not need to assume the existence
of any underlying feature space. Main challenge is that metric constraints
(especially positive-definiteness and sub-additivity), are not automatically
respected if, for example, the coefficients of the linear combination are
allowed to be negative. Both positive and sub-additive constraints are linear
inequalities, but the computational complexity of imposing them scales as
O(D3), where D is the size of the input matrices (i.e. the size of the data
set). This becomes quickly prohibitive, even when D is relatively small. We
propose a new graph-based technique for optimizing under such constraints and
show that, in some cases, our approach may reduce the original computational
complexity of the optimization process by one order of magnitude. Contrarily to
existing methods, our scheme applies to any (possibly non-convex)
metric-constrained objective function."

dimensional feature vector, real world data is rarely found in this form. In
order to meet the basic requirement of traditional learning models, structural
data generally have to be converted into fix-length vectors in a handcrafted
manner, which is tedious and may even incur information loss. A common form of
structured data is what we term ""semantic tree-structures"", corresponding to
data where rich semantic information is encoded in a compositional manner, such
as those expressed in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and eXtensible Markup
Language (XML). For tree-structured data, several learning models have been
studied to allow for working directly on raw tree-structure data, However such
learning models are limited to either a specific tree-topology or a specific
tree-structured data format, e.g., synthetic parse trees. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for end-to-end learning on generic semantic
tree-structured data of arbitrary topology and heterogeneous data types, such
as data expressed in JSON, XML and so on. Motivated by the works in recursive
and recurrent neural networks, we develop exemplar neural implementations of
our framework for the JSON format. We evaluate our approach on several UCI
benchmark datasets, including ablation and data-efficiency studies, and on a
toy reinforcement learning task. Experimental results suggest that our
framework yields comparable performance to use of standard models with
dedicated feature-vectors in general, and even exceeds baseline performance in
cases where compositional nature of the data is particularly important.

learning tasks, there is a lack of theory to understand the way they work. In
particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to perform much
better than Fully-Connected Networks (FCNs) on spatially structured data: the
architectural structure of CNNs benefits from prior knowledge on the features
of the data, for instance their translation invariance. The aim of this work is
to understand this fact through the lens of dynamics in the loss landscape.
  We introduce a method that maps a CNN to its equivalent FCN (denoted as
eFCN). Such an embedding enables the comparison of CNN and FCN training
dynamics directly in the FCN space. We use this method to test a new training
protocol, which consists in training a CNN, embedding it to FCN space at a
certain ``relax time'', then resuming the training in FCN space. We observe
that for all relax times, the deviation from the CNN subspace is small, and the
final performance reached by the eFCN is higher than that reachable by a
standard FCN of same architecture. More surprisingly, for some intermediate
relax times, the eFCN outperforms the CNN it stemmed, by combining the prior
information of the CNN and the expressivity of the FCN in a complementary way.
The practical interest of our protocol is limited by the very large size of the
highly sparse eFCN. However, it offers interesting insights into the
persistence of architectural bias under stochastic gradient dynamics. It shows
the existence of some rare basins in the FCN loss landscape associated with
very good generalization. These can only be accessed thanks to the CNN prior,
which helps navigate the landscape during the early stages of optimization."

This paper investigates how to preserve and extract the abundant information
from graph-structured data into embedding space in an unsupervised manner. To
this end, we propose a novel concept, Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), to
measure the correlation between input graphs and high-level hidden
representations. GMI generalizes the idea of conventional mutual information
computations from vector space to the graph domain where measuring mutual
information from two aspects of node features and topological structure is
indispensable. GMI exhibits several benefits: First, it is invariant to the
isomorphic transformation of input graphs---an inevitable constraint in many
existing graph representation learning algorithms; Besides, it can be
efficiently estimated and maximized by current mutual information estimation
methods such as MINE; Finally, our theoretical analysis confirms its
correctness and rationality. With the aid of GMI, we develop an unsupervised
learning model trained by maximizing GMI between the input and output of a
graph neural encoder. Considerable experiments on transductive as well as
inductive node classification and link prediction demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, and even sometimes
exceeds the performance of supervised ones."
293,['cs.CV'],Effect of top-down connections in Hierarchical Sparse Coding,"Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC) is a powerful model to efficiently represent
multi-dimensional, structured data such as images. The simplest solution to
solve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent
layer-wise subproblems. However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest
inter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory,
which adds top-down connections between consecutive layers. In this study, a
new model called 2-Layers Sparse Predictive Coding (2L-SPC) is introduced to
assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the
2L-SPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a
sequence of independent Lasso layers. The 2L-SPC and the 2-layers Hi-La
networks are trained on 4 different databases and with different sparsity
parameters on each layer. First, we show that the overall prediction error
generated by 2L-SPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers
prediction error between layers. Second, we demonstrate that the inference
stage of the 2L-SPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model. Third, we
show that the 2L-SPC also accelerates the learning process. Finally, the
qualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation

present in the nodes. Existing pooling methods either fail to effectively
capture the graph substructure or do not easily scale to large graphs. In this
work, we propose ASAP (Adaptive Structure Aware Pooling), a sparse and

pooling architectures. ASAP utilizes a novel self-attention network along with
a modified GNN formulation to capture the importance of each node in a given

to effectively pool the subgraphs to form the pooled graph. Through extensive
experiments on multiple datasets and theoretical analysis, we motivate our

deriving the convergence rates of excess risk. In particular, a teacher-student
framework is proposed that assumes the Bayes classifier to be expressed as ReLU
neural networks. In this setup, we obtain a sharp rate of convergence, i.e.,
$\tilde{O}_d(n^{-2/3})$, for classifiers trained using either 0-1 loss or hinge
loss. This rate can be further improved to $\tilde{O}_d(n^{-1})$ when the data
distribution is separable. Here, $n$ denotes the sample size. An interesting
observation is that the data dimension only contributes to the $\log(n)$ term

associated with it. Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs
suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning
representations of nodes only. In this paper, we propose CompGCN, a novel Graph

operations from Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques and scales with the number
of relations. It also generalizes several of the existing multi-relational GCN

feedback-looped filters can guarantee convergence w.r.t. a specified error
bound, and be applied universally to any graph without knowing its structure.
Furthermore, the propagation rule of this model can diversify features from the

and then a discriminative classifier is learned based on the kernels via convex
optimization. However, such an elegant two-stage approach also limited kernel
methods from scaling up to millions of data points, and exploiting
discriminative information to learn feature representations.
  We propose, structure2vec, an effective and scalable approach for structured

feature spaces, and learning such feature spaces using discriminative
information. Interestingly, structure2vec extracts features by performing a
sequence of function mappings in a way similar to graphical model inference
procedures, such as mean field and belief propagation. In applications

extended to graph structure data by a convolutional network, which transforms
the semantic segmentation problem into a graph node classification problem.
Then we apply graph convolutional network to solve this graph node

predicts the three edges involved in a local triad together. The triad decoder
can be readily used in any graph-based auto-encoder. In particular, we

which requires long-term memory to decode. Our data is a simple writing system,
encoding characters 'X' and 'O' as their upper halves, which is possible due to
symmetry of the two characters. The characters can be connected, as in some
languages using cursive, such as Arabic (abjad). The string 'XOOXXO' may be
encoded as

follows that we may need to know arbitrarily long past to decode a current

capable of decoding sequences encoded in this manner. Rather than by training,
we constructed our RNN ""by inspection"", i.e. we guessed its weights. This
involved a sequence of steps. We wrote a conventional program which decodes the
sequences as the example above. Subsequently, we interpreted the program as a

approach can generate the adversarial samples quickly using the GAN
architecture every time facing a new sample after training, but meanwhile needs
to perturb the attack samples in great quantities, which results in the

time-consuming advantage than the non-learning adversarial samples approaches
and a better non-zero-features performance than the GANbased adversarial sample
approaches. FFA-GAN can automatically generate the attack samples in the
black-box attack through the GAN architecture instead of the evolutional

mechanism into the generator network of the GAN architecture to optimize the
constraint issue, which can also be regarded as the sparsity problem of the
important features. During the training, the different weights of losses of the
generator are set in the different training phases to ensure the divergence of
the two above mentioned parallel networks of the generator. Experiments are
made respectively on the structured data sets KDD-Cup 1999 and CIC-IDS 2017, in

Convolutional Network (GCN), has attracted lots of attention, due to its
powerful capability of modeling non-Euclidean structure data. However, many
existing GCN methods provide a pre-defined graph and fix it through the entire
network, which can loss implicit joint correlations. Besides, the mainstream
spectral GCN is approximated by one-order hop, thus higher-order connections
are not well involved. Therefore, huge efforts are required to explore a better
GCN architecture. To address these problems, we turn to Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) and propose the first automatically designed GCN for

providing multiple dynamic graph modules after fully exploring the

The resulted architecture proves the effectiveness of the higher-order

typically requires estimating the input and/or hidden signals in a multi-layer
deep neural network from observation of its output. While these approaches have
been successful in practice, rigorous performance analysis is complicated by
the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problems. This paper
presents a novel algorithm, Multi-Layer Vector Approximate Message Passing
(ML-VAMP), for inference in multi-layer stochastic neural networks. ML-VAMP can
be configured to compute maximum a priori (MAP) or approximate minimum
mean-squared error (MMSE) estimates for these networks. We show that the
performance of ML-VAMP can be exactly predicted in a certain high-dimensional
random limit. Furthermore, under certain conditions, ML-VAMP yields estimates
that achieve the minimum (i.e., Bayes-optimal) MSE as predicted by the replica

data points belonging to the same well-connected subset (cluster) are similar
valued. This lends naturally to learning the labels by total variation (TV)
minimization, which we solve by applying a recently proposed primal-dual method
for non-smooth convex optimization. The resulting algorithm allows for a highly
scalable implementation using message passing over the underlying empirical
graph, which renders the algorithm suitable for big data applications. By
applying tools of compressed sensing, we derive a sufficient condition on the
underlying network structure such that TV minimization recovers clusters in the
empirical graph of the data. In particular, we show that the proposed
primal-dual method amounts to maximizing network flows over the empirical graph
of the dataset. Moreover, the learning accuracy of the proposed algorithm is
linked to the set of network flows between data points having known labels. The
effectiveness and scalability of our approach is verified by numerical

sets for graph classification have repeating instances which cause the problem
of isomorphism bias, i.e. artificially increasing the accuracy of the models by
memorizing target information from the training set. This prevents fair
competition of the algorithms and raises a question of the validity of the

maximal mean discrepancy of random processes. Moreover, by considering the
time-wise independence of random processes, we clarify a connection between our

generate attributes for those nodes whose attributes are completely unobserved.
This task benefits many real-world problems like profiling, node classification
and graph data augmentation. To tackle this task, we propose a deep adversarial
learning based method to generate node attributes; called node attribute neural
generator (NANG). NANG learns a unifying latent representation which is shared
by both node attributes and graph structures and can be translated to different
modalities. We thus use this latent representation as a bridge to convert
information from one modality to another. We further introduce practical
applications to quantify the performance of node attribute generation.
Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets and the
empirical results show that node attributes generated by the proposed method
are high-qualitative and beneficial to other applications. The datasets and
codes are available online."

learn from graph structured data. Despite being general, GCNs are admittedly
inferior to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when applied to vision tasks,
mainly due to the lack of domain knowledge that is hardcoded into CNNs, such as
spatially oriented translation invariant filters. However, a great advantage of
GCNs is the ability to work on irregular inputs, such as superpixels of images.
This could significantly reduce the computational cost of image reasoning
tasks. Another key advantage inherent to GCNs is the natural ability to model
multirelational data. Building upon these two promising properties, in this
work, we show best practices for designing GCNs for image classification; in
some cases even outperforming CNNs on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and PASCAL image

Neural Networks (GNNs), which can be used to analyze graph structured data,
i.e. brain networks constructed by fMRI. One way to interpret important
features is through looking at how the classification probability changes if
the features are occluded or replaced. The major limitation of this approach is
that replacing values may change the distribution of the data and lead to
serious errors. Therefore, we develop a 2-stage pipeline to eliminate the need
to replace features for reliable biomarker interpretation. Specifically, we
propose an inductive GNN to embed the graphs containing different properties of
task-fMRI for identifying ASD and then discover the brain regions/sub-graphs
used as evidence for the GNN classifier. We first show GNN can achieve high
accuracy in identifying ASD. Next, we calculate the feature importance scores
using GNN and compare the interpretation ability with Random Forest. Finally,
we run with different atlases and parameters, proving the robustness of the

tensor co-clustering, which shrink estimated centroids together using a convex
fusion penalty, allow for global optimality guarantees and precise theoretical
analysis, but their computational properties have been less well studied. In
this note, we present three efficient operator-splitting methods for the convex
co-clustering problem: a standard two-block ADMM, a Generalized ADMM which
avoids an expensive tensor Sylvester equation in the primal update, and a
three-block ADMM based on the operator splitting scheme of Davis and Yin.
Theoretical complexity analysis suggests, and experimental evidence confirms,
that the Generalized ADMM is far more efficient for large problems."

these two components, freeing the operation from the confines of the image grid
and allowing the kernel to process any type of structured data. As a test case,
we demonstrate its use by applying it to dense inference on spherical data. We
perform an in-depth study of existing spherical image convolution methods and
propose an improved sampling method for equirectangular images. Then, we
discuss the impact of data discretization when deriving a sampling function,
highlighting drawbacks of the cube map representation for spherical data.
Finally, we illustrate how mapped convolutions enable us to convolve directly
on a mesh by projecting the spherical image onto a geodesic grid and training
on the textured mesh. This method exceeds the state of the art for spherical
depth estimation by nearly 17%. Our findings suggest that mapped convolutions
can be instrumental in expanding the application scope of convolutional neural
networks."

translation, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), can be used for source code
summarization. However, there is a considerable difference between source code

known machine translation models to source code.
  Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) capture these structural properties and play an
important role in recent machine learning studies on source code. Tree-LSTM is
proposed as a generalization of LSTMs for tree-structured data. However, there
is a critical issue when applying it to ASTs: It cannot handle a tree that
contains nodes having an arbitrary number of children and their order
simultaneously, which ASTs generally have such nodes. To address this issue, we
propose an extension of Tree-LSTM, which we call \emph{Multi-way Tree-LSTM} and

The underlying idea of deep domain adaptation is to bridge the gap between
source and target domains in a joint space so that a supervised classifier
trained on labeled source data can be nicely transferred to the target domain.
This idea is certainly intuitive and powerful, however, limited theoretical
understandings have been developed to support its underpinning principle. In
this paper, we have provided a rigorous framework to explain why it is possible
to close the gap of the target and source domains in the joint space. More
specifically, we first study the loss incurred when performing transfer
learning from the source to the target domain. This provides a theory that
explains and generalizes existing work in deep domain adaptation which was
mainly empirical. This enables us to further explain why closing the gap in the

proven to improve performance and is widely used. However, the method of
applying downsampling to graphs is still difficult to perform and has room for
improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph pooling method based on

However, most of the existing graph neural networks suffer from the following
limitations: (1) there is limited analysis regarding the graph convolution
properties, such as seed-oriented, degree-aware and order-free; (2) the node's
degree-specific graph structure is not explicitly expressed in graph
convolution for distinguishing structure-aware node neighborhoods; (3) the
theoretical explanation regarding the graph-level pooling schemes is unclear.
  To address these problems, we propose a generic degree-specific graph neural

explicitly capture the graph topology integrated with node attributes, we argue
that graph convolution should have three properties: seed-oriented,
degree-aware, order-free. To this end, we propose multi-task graph convolution
where each task represents node representation learning for nodes with a
specific degree value, thus leading to preserving the degree-specific graph
structure. In particular, we design two multi-task learning methods:
degree-specific weight and hashing functions for graph convolution. In
addition, we propose a novel graph-level pooling/readout scheme for learning

black-box models. However, the possible loss of the predictive performance for
gaining interpretability is often inevitable, putting practitioners in a
dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and
interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel
framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an
interpretable model with any black-box model to combine their strengths. The
interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where
the black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low
cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that
considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency
(defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.)
Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with
association rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized
training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured
data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various

image interactively based on an incrementally additive text description
(something that is more intuitive and similar to the way we describe an image).
We propose a method to generate an image incrementally based on a sequence of

architecture that preserves the image content generated in previous steps and
modifies the cumulative image as per the newly provided scene information. Our
model utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to cater to variable-sized

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-level learning approach on a
multi-level voxel grid to overcome these drawbacks. To demonstrate the utility
of the proposed multi-level learning, we use a multi-level voxel representation
of 3D objects to perform object recognition. The multi-level voxel
representation consists of a coarse voxel grid that contains volumetric
information of the 3D object. In addition, each voxel in the coarse grid that

algorithm inside a stochastic gradient descent loop: given a family of feature
groupings that capture feature covariations, we randomly select these groups at
each iteration. We show that this approach amounts to enforcing a denoising
regularizer on the solution. The method is easy to implement in many model
architectures, such as fully connected neural networks, and has a linear

Previous methods model skeletons based on RNN or CNN, which has limited
expressive power for irregular skeleton joints. While graph convolutional

the fundamental graph construction remains challenging. In this paper, we
represent skeletons naturally on graphs, and propose a graph regression based
GCN (GR-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition, aiming to capture the
spatio-temporal variation in the data. As the graph representation is crucial
to graph convolution, we first propose graph regression to statistically learn
the underlying graph from multiple observations. In particular, we provide
spatio-temporal modeling of skeletons and pose an optimization problem on the
graph structure over consecutive frames, which enforces the sparsity of the
underlying graph for efficient representation. The optimized graph not only
connects each joint to its neighboring joints in the same frame strongly or
weakly, but also links with relevant joints in the previous and subsequent
frames. We then feed the optimized graph into the GCN along with the
coordinates of the skeleton sequence for feature learning, where we deploy
high-order and fast Chebyshev approximation of spectral graph convolution.
Further, we provide analysis of the variation characterization by the Chebyshev

More specifically, in order to apply Bayesian optimization to structured data,
we extract useful topological information from a structure and measure the

main challenge for multi-graph representation is how to exploit both structure
information of each individual graph and correlation information across
multiple graphs simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel Multiple
Graph Adversarial Learning (MGAL) framework for multi-graph representation and
learning. MGAL aims to learn an optimal structure-invariant and consistent
representation for multiple graphs in a common subspace via a novel adversarial

problem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational
difficulties. In this paper, we present a functional representation for graph
matching (FRGM) that aims to provide more geometric insights on the problem and
reduce the space and time complexities of corresponding algorithms. To achieve
these goals, we represent a graph endowed with edge attributes by a linear
function space equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that
has an explicit geometric meaning. Consequently, the correspondence between
graphs can be represented as a linear representation map of that functional.
Specifically, we reformulate the linear functional representation map as a new
parameterization for Euclidean graph matching, which is associative with
geometric parameters for graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations. This
allows us to estimate the correspondence and geometric deformations
simultaneously. The use of the representation of edge attributes rather than
the affinity matrix enables us to reduce the space complexity by two orders of
magnitudes. Furthermore, we propose an efficient optimization strategy with low
time complexity to optimize the objective function. The experimental results on

However, every heuristic has a strong assumption on when two nodes are likely
to link, which limits their effectiveness on networks where these assumptions

heuristic from a given network instead of using predefined ones. By extracting
a local subgraph around each target link, we aim to learn a function mapping
the subgraph patterns to link existence, thus automatically learning a
`heuristic' that suits the current network. In this paper, we study this
heuristic learning paradigm for link prediction. First, we develop a novel
$\gamma$-decaying heuristic theory. The theory unifies a wide range of
heuristics in a single framework, and proves that all these heuristics can be
well approximated from local subgraphs. Our results show that local subgraphs
reserve rich information related to link existence. Second, based on the

Hence, it is necessary to design dedicated graph neural networks for dynamic

graph evolving. In particular, the proposed framework can keep updating node
information by capturing the sequential information of edges (interactions),
the time intervals between edges and information propagation coherently.
Experimental results on various dynamic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework."

data presented unprecedented potentials for medical and health discoveries but
at the same time significant challenges for machine learning techniques both in
terms of size and complexity. Those challenges include: the structured data
with various storage formats and value types caused by heterogeneous data
sources; the uncertainty widely existing in every aspect of medical diagnosis
and treatments; the high dimensionality of the feature space; the longitudinal
medical records data with irregular intervals between adjacent observations;
the richness of relations existing among objects with similar genetic factors,

Statistical Relational Learning approaches in order to effectively exploit such
health-related data and facilitate the discoveries in medical research. It
presents the work on cost-sensitive statistical relational learning for mining

efficiently compute spectral filters on graphs that specialize on frequency
bands of interest. Our model generates rich spectral filters that are localized
in space, scales linearly with the size of the input data for

paper, we consider the problem of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classification
where previous work has shown that it can be beneficial to incorporate a wide
variety of meta features, such as socio-cultural traits, into predictive
modeling. A graph-based approach naturally suits these scenarios, where a
contextual graph captures traits that characterize a population, while the
specific brain activity patterns are utilized as a multivariate signal at the
nodes. Graph neural networks have shown improvements in inferencing with
graph-structured data. Though the underlying graph strongly dictates the
overall performance, there exists no systematic way of choosing an appropriate
graph in practice, thus making predictive models non-robust. To address this,
we propose a bootstrapped version of graph convolutional neural networks
(G-CNNs) that utilizes an ensemble of weakly trained G-CNNs, and reduce the
sensitivity of models on the choice of graph construction. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on the challenging Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)

statistical analysis with complicated geometric structured data such as shapes,

is a well-known tool to extract robust topological features, and outputs as
\textit{persistence diagrams} (PDs). However, PDs are point multi-sets which
can not be used in machine learning algorithms for vector data. To deal with
it, an emerged approach is to use kernel methods, and an appropriate geometry
for PDs is an important factor to measure the similarity of PDs. A popular
geometry for PDs is the \textit{Wasserstein metric}. However, Wasserstein
distance is not \textit{negative definite}. Thus, it is limited to build
positive definite kernels upon the Wasserstein distance \textit{without
approximation}. In this work, we rely upon the alternative \textit{Fisher
information geometry} to propose a positive definite kernel for PDs
\textit{without approximation}, namely the Persistence Fisher (PF) kernel.
Then, we analyze eigensystem of the integral operator induced by the proposed
kernel for kernel machines. Based on that, we derive generalization error
bounds via covering numbers and Rademacher averages for kernel machines with
the PF kernel. Additionally, we show some nice properties such as stability and
infinite divisibility for the proposed kernel. Furthermore, we also propose a

approaches (e.g., graph convolutional networks), but these methods have
difficulty scaling and generalizing to graphs with different sizes and shapes.
We present Graph2Seq, a new technique that represents vertices of graphs as

Graph2Seq scales naturally to graphs of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Graph2Seq
is also reversible, allowing full recovery of the graph structure from the

local invariance constraint in learning and representation process. That is, if
two data points Xi and Xj are close in the intrinsic geometry of the data
distribution, then their labels/representations should also be close to each
other. This is known as local invariance assumption which plays an essential
role in the development of various kinds of traditional algorithms, such as
dimensionality reduction and semi-supervised learning, in machine learning
area. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a graph Laplacian GCN (gLGCN)
approach for graph data representation and semi-supervised classification. The

data. Though convolution is clearly defined for structured data such as 2D
images or 3D volumes, this is not true for other data types such as sparse
point clouds. Previous techniques have developed approximations to convolutions
for restricted conditions. Unfortunately, their applicability is limited and
cannot be used for general point clouds. We propose an efficient and effective
method to learn convolutions for non-uniformly sampled point clouds, as they
are obtained with modern acquisition techniques. Learning is enabled by four
key novelties: first, representing the convolution kernel itself as a
multilayer perceptron; second, phrasing convolution as a Monte Carlo
integration problem, third, using this notion to combine information from
multiple samplings at different levels; and fourth using Poisson disk sampling
as a scalable means of hierarchical point cloud learning. The key idea across
all these contributions is to guarantee adequate consideration of the
underlying non-uniform sample distribution function from a Monte Carlo
perspective. To make the proposed concepts applicable to real-world tasks, we
furthermore propose an efficient implementation which significantly reduces the
GPU memory required during the training process. By employing our method in
hierarchical network architectures we can outperform most of the
state-of-the-art networks on established point cloud segmentation,
classification and normal estimation benchmarks. Furthermore, in contrast to
most existing approaches, we also demonstrate the robustness of our method with
respect to sampling variations, even when training with uniformly sampled data

vertices are sensors and edges are a learned function of the sensors' spatial
coordinates. As only a subset of IceCube's sensors is active during a given

extreme diversity space, such as \textit{person-behind-person} and
\textit{car-behind-building}, while suffering from the problem of combinatorial
explosion. In this paper, we propose a context-dependent diffusion network
(CDDN) framework to deal with visual relationship detection. To capture the
interactions of different object instances, two types of graphs, word semantic
graph and visual scene graph, are constructed to encode global context
interdependency. The semantic graph is built through language priors to model
semantic correlations across objects, whilst the visual scene graph defines the
connections of scene objects so as to utilize the surrounding scene
information. For the graph-structured data, we design a diffusion network to
adaptively aggregate information from contexts, which can effectively learn
latent representations of visual relationships and well cater to visual

search procedures in the discrete and vast space of chemical structures. We
introduce MolGAN, an implicit, likelihood-free generative model for small
molecular graphs that circumvents the need for expensive graph matching
procedures or node ordering heuristics of previous likelihood-based methods.
Our method adapts generative adversarial networks (GANs) to operate directly on
graph-structured data. We combine our approach with a reinforcement learning
objective to encourage the generation of molecules with specific desired
chemical properties. In experiments on the QM9 chemical database, we
demonstrate that our model is capable of generating close to 100% valid
compounds. MolGAN compares favorably both to recent proposals that use
string-based (SMILES) representations of molecules and to a likelihood-based
method that directly generates graphs, albeit being susceptible to mode
collapse."

might be considered as an extension of basis pursuit from sparse vectors to
network structured datasets. Using a standard first-order oracle model, we
characterize the number of iterations for sparse label propagation to achieve a
prescribed accuracy. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the number of
iterations required to achieve a certain accuracy and show that this upper
bound is sharp for datasets having a chain structure (e.g., time series)."

and it aims to fit and segment multiple-structure data. In this paper, we
propose a novel superpixel-guided two-view geometric model fitting method
(called SDF), which can obtain reliable and consistent results for real images.
Specifically, SDF includes three main parts: a deterministic sampling
algorithm, a model hypothesis updating strategy and a novel model selection
algorithm. The proposed deterministic sampling algorithm generates a set of
initial model hypotheses according to the prior information of superpixels.
Then the proposed updating strategy further improves the quality of model
hypotheses. After that, by analyzing the properties of the updated model
hypotheses, the proposed model selection algorithm extends the conventional
""fit-and-remove"" framework to estimate model instances in multiple-structure
data. The three parts are tightly coupled to boost the performance of SDF in
both speed and accuracy, and SDF has the deterministic nature. Experimental
results show that the proposed SDF has significant advantages over several
state-of-the-art fitting methods when it is applied to real images with
single-structure and multiple-structure data."

interested to design neural networks for graphs with variable length in order
to solve learning problems such as vertex classification, graph classification,
graph regression, and graph generative tasks. Most existing works have focused
on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of
graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have
been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two
fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review
existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of
LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of
analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph
matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures. Numerical
results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and
1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs. Graph ConvNets are also 36% more accurate than

generalize some of the popular metrics, such as the Jaccard and bag distances
on sets, Manhattan distance on vector spaces, and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance
on integrable functions. We prove that the new metrics are complete and show
useful relationships with $f$-divergences for probability distributions. To
further extend our approach to structured objects such as concept hierarchies
and ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic
graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution. We conduct
empirical investigation to demonstrate intuitive interpretation of the new
metrics and their effectiveness on real-valued, high-dimensional, and
structured data. Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the new
metrics outperformed multiple similarity and dissimilarity functions
traditionally used in data mining, including the Minkowski family, the
fractional $L^p$ family, two $f$-divergences, cosine distance, and two
correlation coefficients. Finally, we argue that the new class of metrics is
particularly appropriate for rapid processing of high-dimensional and
structured data in distance-based learning."

To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-convolution operator to
establish correspondences between filter weights and graph neighborhoods with
arbitrary connectivity. The key novelty of our approach is that these
correspondences are dynamically computed from features learned by the network,
rather than relying on predefined static coordinates over the graph as in
previous work. We obtain excellent experimental results that significantly

and pointwise nonlinearity. Since the two first operations are well-defined
only on regular-structured data such as audio or images, application of CNNs to
contemporary datasets where the information is defined in irregular domains is
challenging. This paper investigates CNNs architectures to operate on signals
whose support can be modeled using a graph. Architectures that replace the
regular convolution with a so-called linear shift-invariant graph filter have
been recently proposed. This paper goes one step further and, under the
framework of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) graph filters, imposes
additional structure on the adopted graph filters, to obtain three new (more
parsimonious) architectures. The proposed architectures result in a lower

receptive field size by subsampling neighbors do not have a convergence
guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of
hundreds. In this paper, we develop control variate based algorithms which
allow sampling an arbitrarily small neighbor size. Furthermore, we prove new
theoretical guarantee for our algorithms to converge to a local optimum of GCN.
Empirical results show that our algorithms enjoy a similar convergence with the

etc.) and edges characterize the relationships between these primitives.
However, these non-vectorial graph data cannot be straightforwardly plugged
into off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms without a preliminary step of --
explicit/implicit -- graph vectorization and embedding. This embedding process
should be resilient to intra-class graph variations while being highly
discriminant. In this paper, we propose a novel high-order stochastic graphlet
embedding (SGE) that maps graphs into vector spaces. Our main contribution
includes a new stochastic search procedure that efficiently parses a given
graph and extracts/samples unlimitedly high-order graphlets. We consider these
graphlets, with increasing orders, to model local primitives as well as their
increasingly complex interactions. In order to build our graph representation,
we measure the distribution of these graphlets into a given graph, using
particular hash functions that efficiently assign sampled graphlets into
isomorphic sets with a very low probability of collision. When combined with
maximum margin classifiers, these graphlet-based representations have positive
impact on the performance of pattern comparison and recognition as corroborated
through extensive experiments using standard benchmark databases."

marries these two lines of work. At its core, N-GCN trains multiple instances
of GCNs over node pairs discovered at different distances in random walks, and
learns a combination of the instance outputs which optimizes the classification

technology to domains involving complex 3D data, the success of such efforts
has been constrained, in part, by limitations in data representation
techniques. Most current approaches rely upon low-resolution 3D models,
strategic limitation of scope in the 3D space, or the application of lossy
projection techniques to allow for the use of 2D CNNs. To address this issue,
we present a mapping algorithm that converts 3D structures to 2D and 1D data
grids by mapping a traversal of a 3D space-filling curve to the traversal of
corresponding 2D and 1D curves. We explore the performance of 2D and 1D CNNs

operating upon raw 3D data from a popular benchmarking dataset. Our experiments
demonstrate that both 2D and 1D representations of 3D data generated via our
method preserve a significant proportion of the 3D data's features in forms
learnable by CNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method of encoding 3D
data into lower-dimensional representations allows for decreased CNN training
time cost, increased original 3D model rendering resolutions, and supports
increased numbers of data channels when compared to purely volumetric
approaches. This demonstration is accomplished in the context of a structural
biology classification task wherein we train 3D, 2D, and 1D CNNs on examples of

particular geometric form of the clusters, or by using iterative schemes to
enhance cluster contours, with uncontrollable consequences. The goal of data
analysis should, however, be to encode and detect structural data features at
all scales and densities simultaneously, without assuming a parametric form of
data point distances, or modifying them. We propose a novel approach that

adaptive to the topology of the graph when they scan the graph to perform

constructed, where the vertices represent model hypotheses and the hyperedges
denote data points. The hypergraph involves higher-order similarities (instead
of pairwise similarities used on a simple graph), and it can characterize
complex relationships between model hypotheses and data points. {In addition,
we develop a hypergraph reduction technique to remove ""insignificant"" vertices

study projection pooling layers to reduce the model complexity in the
Grassmannian context, and devise projection mapping layers to respect
Grassmannian geometry and meanwhile achieve Euclidean forms for regular output

relatively small in the number of tested molecules due to its complexity. Here
we approach the problem through deep neural networks as they are flexible in
modeling structured data such as grids, sequences and graphs. We train multiple
BioAssays using a multi-task learning framework, which combines information
from multiple sources to improve the performance of prediction, especially on
small datasets. We propose Graph Memory Network (GraphMem), a memory-augmented

a recurrent controller coupled with an external memory whose cells dynamically
interact and change through a multi-hop reasoning process. Applied to the
molecules, the dynamic interactions enable an iterative refinement of the
representation of molecular graphs with multiple bond types. GraphMem is
capable of jointly training on multiple datasets by using a specific-task query

second new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic
programming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on
first-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable
variable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than
general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to
take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the

By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for

neighborhood of a vertex. Together with the proper choice of graph coarsening,
we explore constructing deep neural networks for graph classification. In
particular, we demonstrate the generality of our formulation in point cloud
classification, where we set the new state of the art, and on a graph
classification dataset, where we outperform other deep learning approaches. The

473,['cs.CV'],A Novel data Pre-processing method for multi-dimensional and non-uniform data,"We are in the era of data analytics and data science which is on full bloom.
There is abundance of all kinds of data for example biometrics based data,
satellite images data, chip-seq data, social network data, sensor based data
etc. from a variety of sources. This data abundance is the result of the fact
that storage cost is getting cheaper day by day, so people as well as almost
all business or scientific organizations are storing more and more data. Most
of the real data is multi-dimensional, non-uniform, and big in size, such that
it requires a unique pre-processing before analyzing it. In order to make data
useful for any kind of analysis, pre-processing is a very important step. This
paper presents a unique and novel pre-processing method for multi-dimensional
and non-uniform data with the aim of making it uniform and reduced in size
without losing much of its value. We have chosen biometric signature data to
demonstrate the proposed method as it qualifies for the attributes of being
multi-dimensional, non-uniform and big in size. Biometric signature data does
not only captures the structural characteristics of a signature but also its
behavioral characteristics that are captured using a dynamic signature capture
device. These features like pen pressure, pen tilt angle, time taken to sign a
document when collected in real-time turn out to be of varying dimensions. This
feature data set along with the structural data needs to be pre-processed in
order to use it to train a machine learning based model for signature
verification purposes. We demonstrate the success of the proposed method over
other methods using experimental results for biometric signature data but the
same can be implemented for any other data with similar properties from a
different domain."
474,['cs.LG'],The All-Paths and Cycles Graph Kernel,"With the recent rise in the amount of structured data available, there has
been considerable interest in methods for machine learning with graphs. Many of
these approaches have been kernel methods, which focus on measuring the
similarity between graphs. These generally involving measuring the similarity
of structural elements such as walks or paths. Borgwardt and Kriegel proposed
the all-paths kernel but emphasized that it is NP-hard to compute and
infeasible in practice, favouring instead the shortest-path kernel. In this
paper, we introduce a new algorithm for computing the all-paths kernel which is
very efficient and enrich it further by including the simple cycles as well. We
demonstrate how it is feasible even on large datasets to compute all the paths
and simple cycles up to a moderate length. We show how to count labelled
paths/simple cycles between vertices of a graph and evaluate a labelled path
and simple cycles kernel. Extensive evaluations on a variety of graph datasets
demonstrate that the all-paths and cycles kernel has superior performance to
the shortest-path kernel and state-of-the-art performance overall."
475,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Deep Over-sampling Framework for Classifying Imbalanced Data,"Class imbalance is a challenging issue in practical classification problems
for deep learning models as well as traditional models. Traditionally
successful countermeasures such as synthetic over-sampling have had limited
success with complex, structured data handled by deep learning models. In this
paper, we propose Deep Over-sampling (DOS), a framework for extending the
synthetic over-sampling method to exploit the deep feature space acquired by a
convolutional neural network (CNN). Its key feature is an explicit, supervised
representation learning, for which the training data presents each raw input
sample with a synthetic embedding target in the deep feature space, which is
sampled from the linear subspace of in-class neighbors. We implement an
iterative process of training the CNN and updating the targets, which induces
smaller in-class variance among the embeddings, to increase the discriminative
power of the deep representation. We present an empirical study using public
benchmarks, which shows that the DOS framework not only counteracts class
imbalance better than the existing method, but also improves the performance of
the CNN in the standard, balanced settings."
476,"['stat.ML', 'cs.IR', 'cs.LG']",Collaborative Filtering with Side Information: a Gaussian Process Perspective,"We tackle the problem of collaborative filtering (CF) with side information,
through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Driven by the idea of
using the kernel to explicitly model user-item similarities, we formulate the
GP in a way that allows the incorporation of low-rank matrix factorisation,
arriving at our model, the Tucker Gaussian Process (TGP). Consequently, TGP
generalises classical Bayesian matrix factorisation models, and goes beyond
them to give a natural and elegant method for incorporating side information,
giving enhanced predictive performance for CF problems. Moreover we show that
it is a novel model for regression, especially well-suited to grid-structured
data and problems where the dependence on covariates is close to being
separable."
477,['cs.CV'],Geometric Multi-Model Fitting with a Convex Relaxation Algorithm,"We propose a novel method to fit and segment multi-structural data via convex
relaxation. Unlike greedy methods --which maximise the number of inliers-- this
approach efficiently searches for a soft assignment of points to models by
minimising the energy of the overall classification. Our approach is similar to
state-of-the-art energy minimisation techniques which use a global energy.
However, we deal with the scaling factor (as the number of models increases) of
the original combinatorial problem by relaxing the solution. This relaxation
brings two advantages: first, by operating in the continuous domain we can
parallelize the calculations. Second, it allows for the use of different
metrics which results in a more general formulation.
  We demonstrate the versatility of our technique on two different problems of
estimating structure from images: plane extraction from RGB-D data and
homography estimation from pairs of images. In both cases, we report accurate
results on publicly available datasets, in most of the cases outperforming the
state-of-the-art."
478,"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",Neural Embeddings of Graphs in Hyperbolic Space,"Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). They provide compact representations that encapsulate word
similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic
tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of
research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is
graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that
encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge
prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph based tasks, embeddings
have been learned in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. However, recent work
has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks
is not the flat Euclidean space, but negatively curved, hyperbolic space. We
present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning
neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental
evidence that embedding graphs in their natural geometry significantly improves
performance on downstream tasks for several real-world public datasets."
479,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Active Learning for Graph Embedding,"Graph embedding provides an efficient solution for graph analysis by
converting the graph into a low-dimensional space which preserves the structure
information. In contrast to the graph structure data, the i.i.d. node embedding
can be processed efficiently in terms of both time and space. Current
semi-supervised graph embedding algorithms assume the labelled nodes are given,
which may not be always true in the real world. While manually label all
training data is inapplicable, how to select the subset of training data to
label so as to maximize the graph analysis task performance is of great
importance. This motivates our proposed active graph embedding (AGE) framework,
in which we design a general active learning query strategy for any
semi-supervised graph embedding algorithm. AGE selects the most informative
nodes as the training labelled nodes based on the graphical information (i.e.,
node centrality) as well as the learnt node embedding (i.e., node
classification uncertainty and node embedding representativeness). Different
query criteria are combined with the time-sensitive parameters which shift the
focus from graph based query criteria to embedding based criteria as the
learning progresses. Experiments have been conducted on three public data sets
and the results verified the effectiveness of each component of our query
strategy and the power of combining them using time-sensitive parameters. Our
code is available online at: https://github.com/vwz/AGE."
480,['cs.CV'],Deep neural networks on graph signals for brain imaging analysis,"Brain imaging data such as EEG or MEG are high-dimensional spatiotemporal
data often degraded by complex, non-Gaussian noise. For reliable analysis of
brain imaging data, it is important to extract discriminative, low-dimensional
intrinsic representation of the recorded data. This work proposes a new method
to learn the low-dimensional representations from the noise-degraded
measurements. In particular, our work proposes a new deep neural network design
that integrates graph information such as brain connectivity with
fully-connected layers. Our work leverages efficient graph filter design using
Chebyshev polynomial and recent work on convolutional nets on graph-structured
data. Our approach exploits graph structure as the prior side information,
localized graph filter for feature extraction and neural networks for high
capacity learning. Experiments on real MEG datasets show that our approach can
extract more discriminative representations, leading to improved accuracy in a
supervised classification task."
481,"['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']",A Generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks to Graph-Structured Data,"This paper introduces a generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) from low-dimensional grid data, such as images, to graph-structured
data. We propose a novel spatial convolution utilizing a random walk to uncover
the relations within the input, analogous to the way the standard convolution
uses the spatial neighborhood of a pixel on the grid. The convolution has an
intuitive interpretation, is efficient and scalable and can also be used on
data with varying graph structure. Furthermore, this generalization can be
applied to many standard regression or classification problems, by learning the
the underlying graph. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the
proposed CNN on MNIST, and challenge the state-of-the-art on Merck molecular
activity data set."
482,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks,"Many different classification tasks need to manage structured data, which are
usually modeled as graphs. Moreover, these graphs can be dynamic, meaning that
the vertices/edges of each graph may change during time. Our goal is to jointly
exploit structured data and temporal information through the use of a neural
network model. To the best of our knowledge, this task has not been addressed
using these kind of architectures. For this reason, we propose two novel
approaches, which combine Long Short-Term Memory networks and Graph
Convolutional Networks to learn long short-term dependencies together with
graph structure. The quality of our methods is confirmed by the promising
results achieved."
483,['stat.ML'],Interactive Graphics for Visually Diagnosing Forest Classifiers in R,"This paper describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore
forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example
of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and
combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which,
with interactive graphics, can provide a lot of insight into class structure in
high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this paper, to assess model
complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension
reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual
observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the
projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged
ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using the ggplot2, plotly, and
shiny packages."
484,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Structural Data Recognition with Graph Model Boosting,"This paper presents a novel method for structural data recognition using a
large number of graph models. In general, prevalent methods for structural data
recognition have two shortcomings: 1) Only a single model is used to capture
structural variation. 2) Naive recognition methods are used, such as the
nearest neighbor method. In this paper, we propose strengthening the
recognition performance of these models as well as their ability to capture
structural variation. The proposed method constructs a large number of graph
models and trains decision trees using the models. This paper makes two main
contributions. The first is a novel graph model that can quickly perform
calculations, which allows us to construct several models in a feasible amount
of time. The second contribution is a novel approach to structural data
recognition: graph model boosting. Comprehensive structural variations can be
captured with a large number of graph models constructed in a boosting
framework, and a sophisticated classifier can be formed by aggregating the
decision trees. Consequently, we can carry out structural data recognition with
powerful recognition capability in the face of comprehensive structural
variation. The experiments shows that the proposed method achieves impressive
results and outperforms existing methods on datasets of IAM graph database
repository."
485,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks,"We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on
graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional
neural networks which operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our
convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of
spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph
edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph
structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation
networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms related methods by a significant margin."
486,"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",On Valid Optimal Assignment Kernels and Applications to Graph Classification,"The success of kernel methods has initiated the design of novel positive
semidefinite functions, in particular for structured data. A leading design
paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured
objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels,
in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can
provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal
assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel
methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that
guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels
give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed
in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing
the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high
classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the
original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel."
487,"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'q-bio.BM']",Protein-Ligand Scoring with Convolutional Neural Networks,"Computational approaches to drug discovery can reduce the time and cost
associated with experimental assays and enable the screening of novel
chemotypes. Structure-based drug design methods rely on scoring functions to
rank and predict binding affinities and poses. The ever-expanding amount of
protein-ligand binding and structural data enables the use of deep machine
learning techniques for protein-ligand scoring.
  We describe convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions that take as
input a comprehensive 3D representation of a protein-ligand interaction. A CNN
scoring function automatically learns the key features of protein-ligand
interactions that correlate with binding. We train and optimize our CNN scoring
functions to discriminate between correct and incorrect binding poses and known
binders and non-binders. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms the
AutoDock Vina scoring function when ranking poses both for pose prediction and
virtual screening."
488,['cs.CV'],Geometric deep learning on graphs and manifolds using mixture model CNNs,"Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several
fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and
computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN)
architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of
image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep
learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D
Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos.
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning,
attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data
such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains
of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In
this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN
architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local,
stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various
non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be
considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed
method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph- and 3D shape
analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches."
489,"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",Variational Graph Auto-Encoders,"We introduce the variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE), a framework for
unsupervised learning on graph-structured data based on the variational
auto-encoder (VAE). This model makes use of latent variables and is capable of
learning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs. We
demonstrate this model using a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a
simple inner product decoder. Our model achieves competitive results on a link
prediction task in citation networks. In contrast to most existing models for
unsupervised learning on graph-structured data and link prediction, our model
can naturally incorporate node features, which significantly improves
predictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets."
490,['cs.CV'],A reliable order-statistics-based approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm,"We propose a new algorithm for fast approximate nearest neighbor search based
on the properties of ordered vectors. Data vectors are classified based on the
index and sign of their largest components, thereby partitioning the space in a
number of cones centered in the origin. The query is itself classified, and the
search starts from the selected cone and proceeds to neighboring ones. Overall,
the proposed algorithm corresponds to locality sensitive hashing in the space
of directions, with hashing based on the order of components. Thanks to the
statistical features emerging through ordering, it deals very well with the
challenging case of unstructured data, and is a valuable building block for
more complex techniques dealing with structured data. Experiments on both
simulated and real-world data prove the proposed algorithm to provide a
state-of-the-art performance."
491,['cs.CV'],The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Noisy Data for Fine-Grained Recognition,"Current approaches for fine-grained recognition do the following: First,
recruit experts to annotate a dataset of images, optionally also collecting
more structured data in the form of part annotations and bounding boxes.
Second, train a model utilizing this data. Toward the goal of solving
fine-grained recognition, we introduce an alternative approach, leveraging
free, noisy data from the web and simple, generic methods of recognition. This
approach has benefits in both performance and scalability. We demonstrate its
efficacy on four fine-grained datasets, greatly exceeding existing state of the
art without the manual collection of even a single label, and furthermore show
first results at scaling to more than 10,000 fine-grained categories.
Quantitatively, we achieve top-1 accuracies of 92.3% on CUB-200-2011, 85.4% on
Birdsnap, 93.4% on FGVC-Aircraft, and 80.8% on Stanford Dogs without using
their annotated training sets. We compare our approach to an active learning
approach for expanding fine-grained datasets."
492,['cs.LG'],Similarity Learning for Time Series Classification,"Multivariate time series naturally exist in many fields, like energy,
bioinformatics, signal processing, and finance. Most of these applications need
to be able to compare these structured data. In this context, dynamic time
warping (DTW) is probably the most common comparison measure. However, not much
research effort has been put into improving it by learning. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for learning similarities based on DTW, in order to
improve time series classification. Making use of the uniform stability
framework, we provide the first theoretical guarantees in the form of a
generalization bound for linear classification. The experimental study shows
that the proposed approach is efficient, while yielding sparse classifiers."

which can not only handle non-linearity in data but also structured output such
as multi-dimensional and multi-label outputs. Specifically, we develop a PSI
algorithm for independence measures, and propose the Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion (HSIC) based PSI algorithm (hsicInf). The novelty of the
proposed algorithm is that it can handle non-linearity and/or structured data
through kernels. Namely, the proposed algorithm can be used for wider range of
applications including nonlinear multi-class classification and multi-variate
regressions, while existing PSI algorithms cannot handle them. Through
synthetic experiments, we show that the proposed approach can find a set of
statistically significant features for both regression and classification
problems. Moreover, we apply the hsicInf algorithm to a real-world data, and
show that hsicInf can successfully identify important features."
494,['cs.CV'],Superpixel-based Two-view Deterministic Fitting for Multiple-structure Data,"This paper proposes a two-view deterministic geometric model fitting method,
termed Superpixel-based Deterministic Fitting (SDF), for multiple-structure
data. SDF starts from superpixel segmentation, which effectively captures prior
information of feature appearances. The feature appearances are beneficial to
reduce the computational complexity for deterministic fitting methods. SDF also
includes two original elements, i.e., a deterministic sampling algorithm and a
novel model selection algorithm. The two algorithms are tightly coupled to
boost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy. Specifically, the
proposed sampling algorithm leverages the grouping cues of superpixels to
generate reliable and consistent hypotheses. The proposed model selection
algorithm further makes use of desirable properties of the generated
hypotheses, to improve the conventional fit-and-remove framework for more
efficient and effective performance. The key characteristic of SDF is that it
can efficiently and deterministically estimate the parameters of model
instances in multi-structure data. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SDF shows superiority over several state-of-the-art fitting methods
for real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data."
495,['cs.CV'],Hypergraph Modelling for Geometric Model Fitting,"In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph based method (called HF) to fit
and segment multi-structural data. The proposed HF formulates the geometric
model fitting problem as a hypergraph partition problem based on a novel
hypergraph model. In the hypergraph model, vertices represent data points and
hyperedges denote model hypotheses. The hypergraph, with large and
""data-determined"" degrees of hyperedges, can express the complex relationships
between model hypotheses and data points. In addition, we develop a robust
hypergraph partition algorithm to detect sub-hypergraphs for model fitting. HF
can effectively and efficiently estimate the number of, and the parameters of,
model instances in multi-structural data heavily corrupted with outliers
simultaneously. Experimental results show the advantages of the proposed method
over previous methods on both synthetic data and real images."
496,['cs.LG'],Diffusion-Convolutional Neural Networks,"We present diffusion-convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), a new model for
graph-structured data. Through the introduction of a diffusion-convolution
operation, we show how diffusion-based representations can be learned from
graph-structured data and used as an effective basis for node classification.
DCNNs have several attractive qualities, including a latent representation for
graphical data that is invariant under isomorphism, as well as polynomial-time
prediction and learning that can be represented as tensor operations and
efficiently implemented on the GPU. Through several experiments with real
structured datasets, we demonstrate that DCNNs are able to outperform
probabilistic relational models and kernel-on-graph methods at relational node
classification tasks."
497,"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",Kernel-based Reconstruction of Graph Signals,"A number of applications in engineering, social sciences, physics, and
biology involve inference over networks. In this context, graph signals are
widely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features in
graph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisy
observations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensively
analyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paper
advocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modeling
and reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signal
reconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of
graph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers fresh
insights, and allows for estimators to leverage richer forms of prior
information than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such as
bandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturally
accommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes on
the so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existing
Thikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilistic
interpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivated
by the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators or
the kernel map in kernel-based methods, the present paper further proposes two
multi-kernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enables
estimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allows
for efficient graph filter selection. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as
real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods relative to
state-of-the-art alternatives."
498,['cs.CV'],Mode-Seeking on Hypergraphs for Robust Geometric Model Fitting,"In this paper, we propose a novel geometric model fitting method, called
Mode-Seeking on Hypergraphs (MSH),to deal with multi-structure data even in the
presence of severe outliers. The proposed method formulates geometric model
fitting as a mode seeking problem on a hypergraph in which vertices represent
model hypotheses and hyperedges denote data points. MSH intuitively detects
model instances by a simple and effective mode seeking algorithm. In addition
to the mode seeking algorithm, MSH includes a similarity measure between
vertices on the hypergraph and a weight-aware sampling technique. The proposed
method not only alleviates sensitivity to the data distribution, but also is
scalable to large scale problems. Experimental results further demonstrate that
the proposed method has significant superiority over the state-of-the-art
fitting methods on both synthetic data and real images."
499,['cs.CV'],Semantic Object Parsing with Graph LSTM,"By taking the semantic object parsing task as an exemplar application
scenario, we propose the Graph Long Short-Term Memory (Graph LSTM) network,
which is the generalization of LSTM from sequential data or multi-dimensional
data to general graph-structured data. Particularly, instead of evenly and
fixedly dividing an image to pixels or patches in existing multi-dimensional
LSTM structures (e.g., Row, Grid and Diagonal LSTMs), we take each
arbitrary-shaped superpixel as a semantically consistent node, and adaptively
construct an undirected graph for each image, where the spatial relations of
the superpixels are naturally used as edges. Constructed on such an adaptive
graph topology, the Graph LSTM is more naturally aligned with the visual
patterns in the image (e.g., object boundaries or appearance similarities) and
provides a more economical information propagation route. Furthermore, for each
optimization step over Graph LSTM, we propose to use a confidence-driven scheme
to update the hidden and memory states of nodes progressively till all nodes
are updated. In addition, for each node, the forgets gates are adaptively
learned to capture different degrees of semantic correlation with neighboring
nodes. Comprehensive evaluations on four diverse semantic object parsing
datasets well demonstrate the significant superiority of our Graph LSTM over
other state-of-the-art solutions."
